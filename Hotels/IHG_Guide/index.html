                    I'm not sure why, but I have an unfounded love towards the Dove bathroom products
                    found in Holiday Inn Express. I am here to walk you through how to get the most out of the IHG
                    program!

                            IHG points. The status comes handy for those that do not want a credit card or those that often stay 
                            at InterContinental Hotels.

                            easy to achieve.

                        <p>
                            The IHG points earning rate is based on the amount of money spent.
                            The budget extended stay brands Staybridge Suites and Candlewood Suites
                            earning half of what other brands earn. The earning rate below is for 
                            standard IHG hotels and resorts, not for the aforementioned budget 
                            extended stay brands.<br><br>

                            <b>Club (no status):</b> 10 points per dollar <br>
                            <b>Silver :</b> 12 points per dollar <br>
                            <b>Gold :</b> 14 points per dollar <br>
                            <b>Platinum :</b> 16 points per dollar <br>
                            <b>Diamond :</b> 20 points per dollar <br>
                            <br>

                            It is possible to substitute earning IHG points on IHG Hotels and Resorts for <a
                                href="https://www.ihg.com/onerewards/content/us/en/earn-rewards/partnerrewards"> airline miles and <b>Rakuten.</b></a>
                            Most airline miles are earned at a rate of 2 miles per dollar for all IHG properties except Candlewood Suites and Staybridge Suites.
                            *Please do note that like most other hotel programs, booking through third party like Expedia
                            or travel portals don't earn points.

                        <p>
                            My favorite way of earning IHG Points (except credit card welcome offers)!
                            Normally, points are on sale for 1 cent per point but many times throughout the year, points sales come with a 100% bonus
                            , pretty amazing when coupled with 4th night free! 
                            Unfortunately, there is maximum of 200,000 points purchased per account
                            per year, a total of 400,000 points with the 100% purchase bonus.

                            Earn 3 point per dollar when hosting a meeting or event at a IHG hotel, up to

                            Much like other programs, a credit card can be linked to their <a
                                href="https://ihgrewardsdineandearn.rewardsnetwork.com/"> dining program</a>
                            to earn IHG points on partnered restaurants. Note that linking a credit card to
                            one dining program will usually unlink it from others. As IHG points are not worth
                            that much, I would advise against this.

                            IHG stays.

                        <p>
                            IHG allows for the flexibility to pay with a combination of points and cash. The trick here is that you can often 
                            "buy" points at half a cent each to cover the cost of the stay. If you cancel, you will receive the full refund in cash.

                            member. Note that to join a pool, the joining
                            member must have held their account for at least 30 days
                            and at least 1,000 points. This is a terrible deal because you have 
                            to pay 0.5 cents per point transferred.

                        <h3>Elite Status Requirements and Benefits</h3>
                        <p>
                            <img src="/assets/IHG Guide/IHG-elite-status.webp"> <br><br>
                            IHG has 3 basic tiers of elite status after general members. Each tier could be earned with
                            either enough points accumulated or nights stayed in a year.
                            Just like all major hotel groups, elite nights and points are only earned when booking
                            direct or through portals like Amex FHR and Chase the Edit. It is
                            my opinion that the easiest way to qualify for IHG elite status is to hold the applicable credit card.
                            <br><br>
                            Platinum status is the highest status to achieve only by holding a credit card. The status 
                            is the first status that allows for complimentary upgrades and early check-in.
                            Other benefits I value are as below: <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                                Free Bottled Water (I know it's odd but I hate paying for water and some hotels don't
                                have water fountains.)

                            To me, the sweet spot in this milestone chart would be at 40 nights, where you can choose an 
                            annual lounge membership.

                            Regarding the other choices, each IHG point is worth 0.5 cents per point. That means 5,000 IHG points is equivalent to $25 and 10,000 IHG points is 
                            equivalent to $50. Since each food and beverage credit is worth $20, 2 food and beverage credit will be equivalent 
                            to $40 while 5 would be equivalent to $100. For me, confirmable suite upgrade would be my first pick, especially at 
                            10 nights, where the food and beverage credit and bonus points are not that high. Next, I would pick the food and 
                            beverage credit, since mathematically, the dollar amount is greater when picking this choice.

                    <p>
                        IHG One credit cards offer solid perks low annual fees. Note that there are legacy IHG Rewards Select cards, 
                        but because there is no way to apply for them any more, this article will not cover them.

                        <p>
                            The no annual fee IHG is a great downgrade option, like every no annual fee
                            co-branded credit card. However, the free card punches above its weight class in several ways.
                            The card comes with automatic IHG Silver status. The card also comes with 4th night free perk.

                        <p>
                            The personal and premier cards essentially come with the same benefits. The only difference
                            between the two cards are the 5x multipliers. The draw of the card would be the annual top off able 40,000 
                            point anniversary free night (essentially worth $200) and IHG Platinum status. Spending $40k on the card 
                            can be a fast way to get to IHG Diamond status as well. Considering the base is essentially 1.5% back, it 
                            is not the worst deal in the world to get free breakfast.
