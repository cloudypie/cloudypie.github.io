                    For those that travel less than 5 times a year,
                    IHG is a fantastic program. For casual travelers, IHG offers unique perks that do not require sinking much time or
                    money into the program. I am here to walk you through how to get the most out of the IHG
                    program!

                        <li>
                            <b>Purchasing Points: </b>IHG points very often go on sale for 0.5 cents per point
                            throughout the year.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>InterContinental Ambassador Status: </b>Buy InterContinental Ambassador status for $225 or 45,000 
                            IHG points. The status comes handy for those that do not want a credit card or those that often stay 
                            at InterContinental Hotels.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>4th Night Free: </b>The 4th night is free on all award bookings. Combined with the points sales 
                            and IHG awards often costing 0.5 cents per point or more, buying points for a free fifth night is really 
                            easy to achieve.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Top Tier Elite Status: </b>The IHG Aspire card can be an easy way to get top tier
                            diamond status for little effort.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Free night certificate: </b>The IHG credit cards come with or have opportunities to
                            earn a free night certificate, usable at any IHG
                            property with standard award availability. This could net $1000+ when used for
                            luxurious properties, like Waldorf Astoria, Conrad and even their partners, like SLH.

                            The IHG points earning rate is based on the amount of money spent, 
                            with the budget extended stay brands Staybridge Suites and Candlewood Suites
                            earning half of what other brands earn, as shown below.<br><br>
                            <img src="/assets/IHG Guide/point-earning.webp"> <br><br>

                            <b>Club (no status):</b> 10 points per dollar <br>
                            <b>Silver :</b> 12 points per dollar <br>
                            <b>Gold :</b> 14 points per dollar <br>

                            <br>
                            Please do note that like most other hotel programs, booking through third party like Expedia
                            or travel portals don't earn points.

                        <p>
                            My favorite way of earning IHG Points (except credit card welcome offers)!
                            Normally, points are on sale for 1 cent per point but many times throughout the year, points sales come with a 100% bonus
                            , pretty amazing when coupled with 4th night free! 
                            Unfortunately, there is maximum of 200,000 points purchased per account
                            per year, a total of 400,000 points with the 100% purchase bonus.

                            Much like other programs, a credit card can be linked to their <a
                                href="https://ihgrewardsdineandearn.rewardsnetwork.com/"> dining program</a>
                            to earn IHG points on partnered restaurants. Note that linking a credit card to
                            one dining program will usually unlink it from others. As IHG points are not worth
                            that much, I would advise against this.

                            IHG no longer has an award chart, but rather are categorized into standard and premium rates. 
                            Standard rates typically price at 0.5 cents per point while premium is much less. Standard awards also have a maximum cap
                            of 250,000 points. The next 3 sections offer some quirks of paying for
                            IHG stays.

                        <p>
                            IHG allows for the flexibility to pay with a combination of points and cash, where the
                            number of points can be reduced by 1,000 point increments. Usually poor value, since the cost to do so with
                            cash is a hair less than the award cents per point.

                            For IHG members that have Silver, Gold, or Diamond status, every award stay with 5 or
                            more consecutive nights will have the fifth night free.
                            The maximum number of nights per stay is 20 nights, so a total of 4 free award nights per
                            stay. Note that pay with points and cash will not trigger this benefit.

                        <p>
                            IHG has 3 tiers of elite status after general members. Each tier could be earned with
                            either enough points, stays, or nights in a year.
                            Just like all major hotel groups, elite nights and points are only earned when booking
                            direct or through portals like Amex FHR and Chase the Edit. It is
                            my opinion that the easiest way to qualify for IHG elite status is to hold the applicable credit card.

                            Lifetime diamond status is earned by being a diamond member for <b>10</b> years and either earning 
                            2 million base points or
                            1000 paid/<b>award</b> nights. To earn 2 million base points, spend $200,000 on
                            IHG hotels (excluding Tru and Home 2 Suites brands).
                            Counting award stays is a pretty nice gesture towards those in the points and miles

                    <h2>IHG Credit Cards</h2>
                    <p>
                        IHG lineup of credit cards is perhaps the most overpowered in the game. The
                        Aspire card gives so much outsized value
                        while the Surpass card provides great multipliers for a co-branded card and a worthwhile incentive to spend on
                        the card. <br>
                    </p>
                    <section id="cc--basic">
                        <h3>IHG</h3>
                        <div id="table-container" data-table="8"></div>
                        <p>
                            The no annual fee IHG is a great downgrade option, like every no annual fee
                            co-branded credit card. However, the free card punches above its weight class in several ways.
                            The card comes with automatic IHG Silver status, which unlocks the IHG 5th night free 
                            on award stays. Also, the card has a chance to earn a IHG Free Night certificate as an elevated 
                            welcome offer a couple times throughout the year. This certificate
                            is applicable to any IHG Hotels worldwide that have a stand room award night. Since these
                            certificates can be used for SLH hotels, which
                            are usually retailing for $1000+, they are extremely valuable and a great incentive to chase
                            with spend.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Like all Amex cards these days, it comes with credits to offset the annual fee, but the
                            credits for this card are pretty easy to use. The $50 every quarter could be used
                            when purchasing a IHG gift card online (if it comes back) or at IHG and restaurants located
                            inside IHG hotels. The card also comes with IHG Gold status, the same status the 
                            <a id="amexpcc" href="#">American Express Platinum</a>.
                            Surprising, the card earns 6x (effectively 3%) on groceries,
                            gas, and dining and 3x (effectively 1.5%) everywhere else, making it a decent everyday earner.
                            In addition, the card also incentives spend by granting 1
                            IHG Free Night Certificate after $15,000 of spend a year.

                            annual fee. The card grants IHG's
                            top tier status, Diamond status. This makes IHG status the easiest to achieve.
                            The card also grants a free night certificate <b>each year.</b> This card is the king of 
                            all cards!

                            The card once again comes with $60 a quarter at IHG. The card also gives IHG Gold
                            status, like the IHG Surpass. The card's main draw is the 5x (effectively 2.5%)
                            multiplier on everything. However, there is a cap of $100,000 a year and no free night
                            certificate as a spend incentive. Unfortunately, the direction that IHG took is quite
                            puzzling. The existence of a cap will drive away high business spenders and for the average
                            Joe, the lack of a spend incentive may cause them to look else where (like welcome offers)
                            to concentrate their spend on.
