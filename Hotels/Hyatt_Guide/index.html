                    Hyatt is the most rewarding hotel program for those that are loyal and stay often with them each year.
                    I am here to walk you through how to get the most out of the Hyatt
                    program!

                            are no resort fees on award bookings either.

                        <li>
                            <b>Elite Recognition: </b>Globalist (highest status) offers the best benefits out of any hotel group. 
                            Free breakfast or club access, guaranteed upgrades, free parking, no resort fees on paid stays, and guaranteed 4 pm 
                            late checkout at non-resort properties give Hyatt an edge for loyalists.

                            <b>Chase and Bilt: </b>With Hyatt points typically around 1.7-2 cents per point, transferring 1 Chase or Bilt point 
                            to 1 Hyatt point is a good way to get value on a hotel stay.

                            the member gets a category 1-4 certificates.

                        <p>
                            The Hyatt points earning rate is based on the amount of money spent. No matter the tier, 
                            each stay will earn 5 base points per dollar, with the rest of points earned being bonus points. Hyatt 
                            Studios earn half, so 2.5 base points per dollar.
                            More on the difference in a later section.<br><br>

                            <b>General Member:</b> 5 base points per dollar <br>
                            <b>Discoverist:</b> 5.5 points per dollar <br>
                            <b>Explorist :</b> 6 points per dollar <br>
                            <b>Globalist:</b> 6.5 points per dollar <br>

                            Please do note that like most other hotel programs, booking through third party like Expedia
                            or travel portals
                            don't earn points.

                        <p>
                            Points typically go on sale for 2.4 cents per point, up to a maximum of 55,000 points per year. However, they frequently go on sale for 20% or 2.04 
                            cents per point. Not the best value so would not recommend.

                            Hyatt follows several award charts shown below. For a standard room, category 1 and 2 represent great value on the low end and are great
                            for budget stays. Category 7 and 8 encompass the high end hotels, which may get more than 2 cents per point, as there isn't
                            a real ceiling for cash prices of those hotels. Typically, Hyatt points are touted as holding 2 cents per point or greater. In practice,
                            they are more often than not worth around 1.7 cents per point, which is still great value for points. <br><br>

                            All inclusive will fall into a different award chart, with the Miraval 
                            brand (also all inclusive) falling into another award chart too. <br><br>

                            Hyatt also allows for the flexibility of booking 
                            directly into club rooms, suites, and premium suites without charging an arm and a leg. Unfortunately, the one exception to the award charts are Mr and Mrs Smith properties.
                            Their redemptions are dynamic and usually mirror close to cash value, or 1 cent per point. For more information on how much hotel and all inclusive club rooms, suites, and premium 
                            suites cost, visit <a href="https://world.hyatt.com/content/gp/en/rewards/free-nights-upgrades.html">Hyatt's website.</a>

                            Hyatt allows for the flexibility to pay with half of the points required for a stay and the rest in cash. 
                            The cash component is 50% to 70% of the 
                            standard cash rate. At 50%, the value is good, but anymore and I would not recommend this method.

                            Hyatt allows for redeeming points on a paid stay to upgrade to a suite. Resort hotels require a deluxe room booking, while 
                            all other hotels just require a standard room booking. The cost for a suite upgrade is 6,000 points while a premium suite 
                            upgrade is 9000 points.

                            Hyatt points can be transferred to airline miles at a rate of less than 1 to 1. I would highly discourage this method of redemption, as the 
                            transfer rate is quite low.

                        <h3>Elite Status Requirements</h3>
                        <p>
                            Hyatt now has 3 tiers of elite status after general members. Notice how the requirements say base points, 
                            rather than bonus points. Extra points earned by elite status, credit cards  do not help qualify for elite status with Hyatt.
                            Here are the requirements to earn each status tier:<br><br>

                            <br>

                            Just like all major hotel groups, qualifying nights and points are only earned when booking
                            direct or through portals like Amex FHR and Chase the Edit. It is
                            my opinion that the easiest way to qualify for Hyatt elite status is to hold the applicable credit card.

                            Honestly, the only status worth chasing after is Globalist. Explorist benefits are pretty nonexistent 
                            over Discoverist. The chart doesn't show it, but an additional Globalist benefit is no resort fees on <b>paid</b> stays.
                            Most of the benefits I value are are from Globalist tier but free bottle is as below: <br>

                        Hyatt lineup is, in my opinion, over hyped. The best way to earn Hyatt points is by spending on Chase's core cards and the Bilt cards.

                            The card's main perks are to obtain a category 1-4 free night certificate on anniversary and 15k in spend and obtain 
                            qualifying nights to accelerate the path to status. For the amount of spend needed and that people put on to reach globalist, 
                            this card is definitely over hyped compared to the free night certificate obtained from the Amex Hilton Aspire 
                            and Amex Hilton Surpass cards.

                            The primary perks of this card is to obtain more qualifying nights for less spend than the personal Hyatt card, up to $50,000 in spend 
                            per year. It also comes with a 10% award discount and Hyatt leverage membership that could be useful. However, for the annual fee, 
                            it is hard to recommend this card.
