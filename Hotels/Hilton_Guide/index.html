                    <i>March 27, 2025 by Worldly Express </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To me, Hilton is a program that is the most friendly to people like me that don't have many vacation
                    days to travel.
                    For us, Hilton offers unique perks that do not require much time or monetary investments into the
                    program. I am here to
                    walk you through how to get the most out of the Hilton Honors program!

                    <h2> Top 5 Takeaways</h2>
                    <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Purchasing Points: Hilton points very often go on sale for 0.5 cents per point throughout
                            the year.
                            To make math on how much awards cost and how many points you're earning, divide award prices
                            by 200 for the cash
                            cost and divide credit card multipliers by 2 for a more "accurate" multiplier.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            5th Night Free: The 5th night is free on all award bookings.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Top Tier Elite Status: The Hilton Aspire card can be an easy way to get top tier diamond
                            status for little effort.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Free night certificate: The Hilton Aspire awards one a free night certificate annually,
                            which are available to use for any Hilton property with standard
                            award availability. Both the Amex Hilton Aspire and Hilton Surpass card also have a free
                            night certificate as a spend
                            incentive he Hilton Aspire awards one annually. This could net $1000+ when used for
                            luxurious properties, like Waldorf Astoria, Conrad and
                            even their partner, SLH.

                        <li>
                            Elite Food Benefit: Elite status "food" benefit is granted to both Gold and Diamond members.
                            Internationally, this is a free breakfast for 2,
                            as you can expect with most hotel programs. However, in the United States this credit is
                            dolled out in "food and beverage credits", which could be used
                            for any meal of the day but usually not enough to cover the entire meal.

                        <p>
                            In general, Hilton Honors has made earning from stays very simple. The Hilton points earning
                            rate is based on the amount of money spent,
                            with the Home 2 Suites and Tru Hotels brands earning half of what other is shown below. This
                            is most likely
                            due to the properties focused on the budget market.<br><br>

                            Please do note that like most other hotel programs, booking through third party like Expedia
                            or travel portals
                            don't earn points. There are also frequent promotions that will triple the amount base
                            points earned, making stays quite lucrative.

                            Much like other programs, Hilton allows you to link a credit card to their <a href = "https://www.hiltonhonorsdining.com/"> dining program</a>
                            to earn Hilton Honors points on partnered restaurants. Note that linking a credit card to one dining program will usually unlink it from others.

                        <h3>Transfer Partners</h3>
                        <p>
                            All of the below transfer partners represent a poor value at the ratio they are transfer. This is due to the frequent point sales that make me value 
                            Hilton points at 0.5 cents per point.<br><br>   
                            <b>Amex MR: </b>1 MR:2 Hilton Honors points. This pegs the MR point at 1 cent per point. MR points are worth at a minimum of 1.1 cents per point 
                            when cashing out through Charles Schwab Invest with rewards so this is not a good deal. However, Hilton may offer transfer bonuses of 1.3x-1.5x, 
                            which would bring the MR point value to 1.3-1.5 cents per point respectively. While not a great deal, it is better than the 1 cpp cash out rate. <br>
                            <b>Diners Club: </b>1250 Club Rewards to 2000 Hilton Honors Points <br>

                        <p>
                            Hilton no longer has an award chart but their awards can still be highly lucrative for higher end properties.
                            The awards are categorized into standard and premium rates, where the latter costs significantly more in price for the same room. 
                            Standard rates typically price at 0.5 cents per point while premium is much less. Standard awards also have a maximum cap of 150,000 points,
                            which makes some of the partner SLH hotels that cost over $1000 a night to be extremely good value redemptions. The next 3 sections 
                            offer some quirks of using your Hilton Honors stays.

                        <p>
                           Hilton allows for the flexibility to pay with a combination of points and cash, where the number of points can be reduced by 1,000 point incrememnts.
                           Usually the cost to do so with cash is a hair less than the award CPP so paying in full with points will always represent better value.

                            The maximum number of nights per stay is 20 nights, so a total of 4 free award nights per stay. Note that pay with points and cash will not trigger
                            this benefit.

                            Another way to increase your points is to pool your family and friend's poits together. Members can transfer up to 500,000 points to another 
                            member and receive up to 2 milion points each year. Note that to join a pool, the joining member must have had their account for at least 30 days
                            and have at least 1000 points.

                            I'm going to list additional ways that you can redeem Hilton points with their partners but these all represent terrible value.
                            The only time I see value in redeeming points this way is if you earn millions of Hilton points each year and you can't use them all.

                        <h3>Elite Status Requirements</h3>
                        <p>
                            Hilton has 3 tiers of elite status after general members. Each tier could be earned with either enough points, stays, or nights in a year.
                            Just like all major hotel groups, elite nights and points are only earned when booking direct or through portals like Amex FHR. It is 
                            my opinion that the easiest way to qualify for Hilton elite status is to hold a credit card.

                            To me, the sweet spot would be gold, where you can receive the food and beverage credit. Other benefits I value are as below: <br><br>

                        <p>
                            Hilton has one way to earn <a href="https://help.hilton.com/s/article/How-do-I-become-a-Lifetime-Diamond-Member">lifetime status.</a> 
                            By being a diamond member for <b>10</b> years and either earning 2 million base points or 1000 paid or <b></b>award nights, you can become a lifetime 
                            diamond member. To earn 2 million base points, this pretty much means spending $200,000 on Hilton hotels (excluding Tru and Home 2 Suites brands).
                            Counting award stays is a pretty friendly action towards those of us in the points and miles game!

                        Delta has what I consider to be the most well rounded/best hubs. There are 2 hubs on each
                        coast
                        for international gateways, 4 fortress hubs for serving
                        airports in the middle of the country, and La Guardia for more east coast to New York
                        flights.
                        Here are Delta's hubs in order of the market share at the airport.
                        The higher the airport is on the list, the more likely that the
                        flight you want will be operated by Delta.
