                    For those that travel less than 5 times a year,
                    Hilton is a fantastic program. For us, Hilton offers unique perks that do not require much time or
                    money into the program. I am here to walk you through how to get the most out of the Hilton Honors
                    program!

                        <li>
                            <b>Purchasing Points: </b>Hilton points very often go on sale for 0.5 cents per point
                            throughout the year. To make the math easy for how much awards cost and how many points
                            you're
                            earning, divide award prices by 200 for the cash cost and divide credit card multipliers by
                            2 for a more "accurate" multiplier.

                        <li>
                            <b>Elite Food Benefit: </b>Elite status "food" benefit comes with both Gold and Diamond
                            members. Internationally, this is a free breakfast for 2, in line with most hotel
                            programs. However, in the United States this credit is dolled out in "food and beverage
                            credits", which could be used for any meal of the day but usually not enough to cover the
                            entire meal.

                            <b>Top Tier Elite Status: </b>The Hilton Aspire card can be an easy way to get top tier
                            diamond status for little effort.

                        <li>
                            <b>Free night certificate: </b>The Hilton credit cards come with or have opportunities to
                            earn a free night certificate. These certificates are available to use for any Hilton
                            property with standard award availability. This could net $1000+ when used for
                            luxurious properties, like Waldorf Astoria, Conrad and even their partners, like SLH.

                        <h3>Hilton Stays</h3>
                        <p>
                            In general, Hilton Honors has made earning from stays very simple. The Hilton points earning
                            rate is based on the amount of money spent, with the Home 2 Suites and Tru Hotels brands
                            earning half of what others earn, as shown below. This is most likely because the 2 brands
                            focus on the budget market so are not as rewarding.<br><br>
                            <img src="/assets/Hilton Guide/point-earning.webp"> <br><br>

                            <b>General Member:</b> 10 points per dollar <br>
                            <b>Silver :</b> 12 points per dollar <br>
                            <b>Gold :</b> 18 points per dollar <br>
                            <b>Diamond :</b> 20 points per dollar <br>
                            <br>
                            Please do note that like most other hotel programs, booking through third party like Expedia
                            or travel portals
                            don't earn points. There are also frequent promotions that will triple the amount base
                            points earned, making stays quite lucrative.

                        <h3>Buying Points</h3>
                        <p>
                            My favorite way of earning Hilton Honors Points (except credit card welcome offers)!
                            Normally, points are on sale for 1 cent per point but many times throughout the year, points
                            are on sale for 0.5 cents per point, giving opportunites to redeem for Hilton hotels
                            when coupled with 5th night free! There is maximum of 80,000 points purchased per account
                            per year, but typically the limit is increased when the points go on sale. Also, Hilton
                            allows
                            you to pool points with other members, effectively increasing the annual purchase limit.

                        <p>
                            Earn 1 point per dollar when hosting a meeting or event at a Hilton hotel. The maximum
                            number of points that can be earned is 100,000 points each year.

                        <h3>Dining Portal</h3>
                        <p>
                            Much like other programs, Hilton allows you to link a credit card to their <a
                                href="https://www.hiltonhonorsdining.com/"> dining program</a>
                            to earn Hilton Honors points on partnered restaurants. Note that linking a credit card to
                            one dining program will usually unlink it from others. As Hilton points are not worth
                            that much, I would advise against this.

                            All of the below transfer partners represent a poor value at the ratio they are transfer. At
                            the transfer ratio listed below, I would highly discourage transferring.<br><br>
                            <b>Amex MR: </b>1 MR:2 Hilton Honors points. This pegs the MR point at 1 cent per point. MR
                            points are worth at a minimum of 1.1 cents per point when cashing out through Charles Schwab
                            Invest with rewards so this is not a good deal. However, Hilton may offer transfer bonuses
                            of 1.3x-1.5x, which would bring the MR point value to 1.3-1.5 cents per point respectively.
                            While not a great deal, it is better than the 1.1 cpp cash out rate. <br>

                            Hilton no longer has an award chart but their awards can still be highly lucrative for
                            higher end properties. The awards are categorized into standard and premium rates, where the
                            latter costs significantly more in price for the same room. Standard rates typically price
                            at 0.5 cents per point while premium is much less. Standard awards also have a maximum cap
                            of 150,000 points, which makes some of the partner SLH hotels that cost over $1000 a night
                            to be high cent per point redemptions. The next 3 sections offer some quirks of using your
                            Hilton Honors stays.

                            Hilton allows for the flexibility to pay with a combination of points and cash, where the
                            number of points can be reduced by 1,000 point incrememnts. Usually the cost to do so with
                            cash is a hair less than the award CPP so paying in full with points will always represent
                            better value.

                            The maximum number of nights per stay is 20 nights, so a total of 4 free award nights per
                            stay. Note that pay with points and cash will not trigger

                            and have at least 1,000 points.

                        <p>
                            Hilton has 3 tiers of elite status after general members. Each tier could be earned with
                            either enough points, stays, or nights in a year.
                            Just like all major hotel groups, elite nights and points are only earned when booking
                            direct or through portals like Amex FHR. It is
                            my opinion that the easiest way to qualify for Hilton elite status is to hold a credit card.

                            diamond member. To earn 2 million base points, this pretty much means spending $200,000 on
                            Hilton hotels (excluding Tru and Home 2 Suites brands).

                    <p>
                        I'd say the Hilton lineup of credit cards is perhaps the most overpowered in the game. The
                        Aspire card gives so much outsized value
                        while the Surpass card has great multipliers for a cobranded card and an incentive to spend on
                        the card. <br>

                        <p>
                            The no annual fee Hilton Honors is again, a great downgrade option, like every no annual fee
                            cobranded credit card. However, I do belive that the card is probably one of the best no
                            annual fee co branded cards. The card comes with automatic Hilton Silver status, which
                            unlocks the Hilton 5th night free on award stays. The card also earns 3x Hilton points per
                            dollar, or 1.5% everywhere (valuing Hilton points at 0.5 cents per point). Also, the card
                            has a chance to earn a free night certificate as an elevated welcome offer a couple times
                            throughout the year. All for $0!

                        <p>
                            Like all Amex cards these days, it comes with credits to offset the annual fee, but the
                            credits for this card are pretty easy to use. The $50 every quarter could easily be used
                            when purchasing a Hilton giftcard online. The
                            card also comes with Hilton Gold status.
                            I wouldn't value that into my own calculation of the card because I have the Amex Platinum
                            and that card also
                            provides Hilton Gold status. However, something surprising
                            is that a cobranded credit card could actually be a great daily spender card. The card earns
                            6x (effectively 3%) on groceries,
                            gas, and dining and 3x (effectively 1.5%) everywhere else. These are great multipliers for
                            usually the biggest day to day expenses.
                            However, the card also incentives spend. After spending $15,000 a year, the card grants 1
                            Hilton Free Night Certificate. This certificate
                            is applicable to any Hilton Hotels worldwide that have a stand room award night. Since these
                            certificates can be used for SLH hotels, which
                            are usually retailing for $1000+, they are extremely valuable and a great incentive to chase
                            with spend.

                            The most hyped up (and for good reason) of all credit cards, <b>THE Hilton Aspire</b>. The

                            annual fee. The real perks comes with its other benefits though. The card grants Hilton's
                            top tier status, Diamond status. This makes Hilton status the easiest to achieve, as you
                            only need to hold a credit card to obtain it. The card also grants a free night certificate
                            each year. As discussed above, this also will easily pay for the card's annual fee and more.
                            This makes the Hilton Aspire card a no brainer and why it is so hyped up.

                            earning and annual fee structure. The card once again comes with coupons, except this time,
                            it is $60 a quarter at Hilton. This incremental difference to the Surpass credit is actually
                            quite annoying, as the Hilton giftcards could only be purchased in $50 increments, meaning
                            you'll have to spend the last $10 in a different way. The card also gives Hilton Gold
                            status, like the Hilton Surpass. The card's main draw is the 5x (effectively 2.5%)
                            multiplier on everything. However, there is a cap of $100,000 a year and no free night
                            certificate as a spend incentive. The catch-all multiplier is not too bad for those that
                            value Hilton points highly. Unfortunately, the direction that Hilton took is quite
                            puzzling. The existence of a cap will drive away high business spenders and for the average
                            Joe, the lack of a spend incentive may cause them to look else where (like welcome offers)
                            to concentrate their spend on.
