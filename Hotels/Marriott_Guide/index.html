                    For those that travel less than 5 times a year,
                    Marriott is a fantastic program. For casual travelers, Marriott offers unique perks that do not require sinking much time or
                    money into the program. I am here to walk you through how to get the most out of the Marriott Bonvoy
                    program!

                        <h3>Marriott Stays</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Marriott points earning rate is based on the amount of money spent. Most brands earn 10 
                            point per dollar spent. Brand exclusions include Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, Element, 
                            Homes & Villas, Sonder, Protea Hotels, City Express, Four Points Flex by Sheraton which earn 5 points 
                            per dollar. StudioRes brand earns 4 points per dollar while Marriott Executive Apartments earn 2.5 points 
                            per dollar. Each level of elite status earns a bonus percentage on points earned.<br><br>

                            <b>General Member:</b> 10% bonus or 10 points per dollar (most brands) <br>
                            <b>Silver:</b> 10% bonus or 11 points per dollar (most brands) <br>
                            <b>Gold:</b> 25% bonus or 12.5 points per dollar (most brands) <br>
                            <b>Platinum:</b> 50% bonus or 15 points per dollar (most brands) <br>
                            <b>Titanium & Ambassador :</b> 75% bonus or 17.5 points per dollar (most brands) <br>
                            <br>
                            Please do note that like most other hotel programs, booking through third party like Expedia
                            or travel portals
                            don't earn points. There are also frequent lucrative promotions, like ones that triple the amount base
                            points earned.

                        <h3>Buying Points</h3>
                        <p>
                            Marriott points are usually sold for 1.25 cents per point. However, points are frequently on sale 
                            for 0.89 cents per point, which I would consider the floor for these points.

                            Much like other programs, a credit card can be linked to their <a

                            to earn Marriott Bonvoy points on partnered restaurants. Note that linking a credit card to
                            one dining program will usually unlink it from others. As Marriott points are not worth
                            that much, I would advise against this.

                        <p>
                            Marriott no longer has an award chart, but rather are completely dynamic. Keep in mind that if resort fees are applicable, then 
                            the resort fees will be tacked on to the award cost. The next 3 sections offer some quirks of paying for
                            IHG stays.

                        <h3>Pay with Points and Money </h3>
                        <p>
                            Marriott allows for the flexibility to pay with a combination of points and cash, where the
                            number of points can be reduced by 1,000 point increments. Usually poor value, since the cost to do so with
                            cash is a hair less than the award cents per point.

                        <p>
                            For Marriott members that have Silver, Gold, or Diamond status, every award stay with 5 or
                            more consecutive nights will have the fifth night free.
                            The maximum number of nights per stay is 20 nights, so a total of 4 free award nights per
                            stay. Note that pay with points and cash will not trigger this benefit.

                        <h3>Elite Status Requirements</h3>
                        <p>
                            Marriott now has 4 tiers of elite status after general members. 
                            Here are the requirements to earn each status tier:<br><br>
                            <b>Silver:</b> 10 nights, 4 stays or $2,500 USD spend<br>
                            <b>Gold:</b> 25 nights, 15 stays, or $6,000 USD spend<br>
                            <b>Diamond:</b> 50 nights, 25 stays, or $11,500 USD spend<br>
                            <b>Diamond Reserve:</b> 80 nights or 40 stays, and $18,000 USD annual eligible spend<br><br>

                            Just like all major hotel groups, elite nights and points are only earned when booking
                            direct or through portals like Amex FHR and Chase the Edit. It is
                            my opinion that the easiest way to qualify for Marriott elite status is to hold the applicable credit card.
                        </p>

                            Gold is the sweet spot to receive the food and beverage credit. The 4 pm guaranteed late check-out 
                            from Diamond Reserve is a great perk, but being locked behind a paywall of $18,000 makes it unappealing 
                            to seek after.
                            Other benefits I value are as below: <br>

                    <h2>Marriott Bonvoy Credit Cards</h2>
                    <p>
                        Marriott lineup of credit cards is perhaps the most overpowered in the game. The
                        Aspire card gives so much outsized value
                        while the Surpass card provides great multipliers for a co-branded card and a worthwhile incentive to spend on
                        the card. <br>
                    </p>
                    <section id="cc--basic">
                        <h3>Marriott Bonvoy</h3>
                        <div id="table-container" data-table="8"></div>
                        <p>
                            The no annual fee Marriott Bonvoy is a great downgrade option, like every no annual fee
                            co-branded credit card. However, the free card punches above its weight class in several ways.
                            The card comes with automatic Marriott Silver status, which unlocks the Marriott 5th night free 
                            on award stays. Also, the card has a chance to earn a Marriott Free Night certificate as an elevated 
                            welcome offer a couple times throughout the year. This certificate
                            is applicable to any Marriott Hotels worldwide that have a stand room award night. Since these
                            certificates can be used for SLH hotels, which
                            are usually retailing for $1000+, they are extremely valuable and a great incentive to chase
                            with spend.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section id="cc--surpass">
                        <h3>Marriott Bonvoy Surpass</h3>
                        <div id="table-container" data-table="9"></div>
                        <p>
                            Like all Amex cards these days, it comes with credits to offset the annual fee, but the
                            credits for this card are pretty easy to use. The $50 every quarter could be used
                            when purchasing a Marriott gift card online (if it comes back) or at Marriott and restaurants located
                            inside Marriott hotels. The card also comes with Marriott Gold status, the same status the 
                            <a id="amexpcc" href="#">American Express Platinum</a>.
                            Surprising, the card earns 6x (effectively 3%) on groceries,
                            gas, and dining and 3x (effectively 1.5%) everywhere else, making it a decent everyday earner.
                            In addition, the card also incentives spend by granting 1
                            Marriott Free Night Certificate after $15,000 of spend a year.

                            The most hyped up (and for good reason) of all credit cards, <b>THE Marriott Aspire</b>. The
                            already comes with decently easy to use coupons that give $600 in value, more than the
                            annual fee. The card grants Marriott's
                            top tier status, Diamond status. This makes Marriott status the easiest to achieve.
                            The card also grants a free night certificate <b>each year.</b> This card is the king of 
                            all cards!

                        <p>
                            The card once again comes with $60 a quarter at Marriott. The card also gives Marriott Gold
                            status, like the Marriott Surpass. The card's main draw is the 5x (effectively 2.5%)
                            multiplier on everything. However, there is a cap of $100,000 a year and no free night
                            certificate as a spend incentive. Unfortunately, the direction that Marriott took is quite
                            puzzling. The existence of a cap will drive away high business spenders and for the average
                            Joe, the lack of a spend incentive may cause them to look else where (like welcome offers)
                            to concentrate their spend on.
