                    For those that travel less than 5 times a year,
                    Marriott is a fantastic program. For casual travelers, Marriott offers unique perks that do not require sinking much time or
                    money into the program. I am here to walk you through how to get the most out of the Marriott Bonvoy
                    program!

                    <section id="earning--stays">
                        <h3>Marriott Stays</h3><br><br>
                        <img src="/assets/Marriott Guide/Point-Earning.webp"><br><br>
                        <p>
                            The Marriott points earning rate is based on the amount of money spent. Most brands earn 10 
                            point per dollar spent. Brand exclusions include Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, Element, 
                            Homes & Villas, Sonder, Protea Hotels, City Express, Four Points Flex by Sheraton which earn 5 points 
                            per dollar. StudioRes brand earns 4 points per dollar while Marriott Executive Apartments earn 2.5 points 
                            per dollar. Each level of elite status earns a bonus percentage on points earned.<br><br>

                            <b>General Member:</b> 10% bonus or 10 points per dollar (most brands) <br>
                            <b>Silver:</b> 10% bonus or 11 points per dollar (most brands) <br>
                            <b>Gold:</b> 25% bonus or 12.5 points per dollar (most brands) <br>
                            <b>Platinum:</b> 50% bonus or 15 points per dollar (most brands) <br>
                            <b>Titanium & Ambassador :</b> 75% bonus or 17.5 points per dollar (most brands) <br>
                            <br>
                            Please do note that like most other hotel programs, booking through third party like Expedia
                            or travel portals
                            don't earn points. There are also frequent lucrative promotions, like ones that triple the amount base
                            points earned.

                        <h3>Buying Points</h3>
                        <p>
                            Marriott points are usually sold for 1.25 cents per point. However, points are frequently on sale 
                            for 0.89 cents per point, which I would consider the floor for these points.

                            Earn 2 point per dollar when hosting a meeting or event at a Marriott hotel, up to 
                            105,000 points each year for Titanium and Ambassador Elite members and 60,000 points each 
                            year for everyone else. Swap Marriott points for up to 20,000 airline miles instead. 
                            Earn 1 Elite Night Credit for every 20 room nights you book, 
                            up to 20 Elite Night Credits per event.

                        <p>
                            Much like other programs, a credit card can be linked to their <a
                                href="https://eataroundtown.marriott.com/earn"> dining program</a>
                            to earn Marriott Bonvoy points on partnered restaurants. Note that linking a credit card to
                            one dining program will usually unlink it from others. Earn 6 points per dollar for elite members 
                            and 4 points per dollar for every one else. As Marriott points are not worth
                            that much, I would advise against this.

                        <p>
                            Marriott has a secret award chart, but the ranges are so large that it is pretty much dynamic. Keep in mind that if resort fees are applicable, then 
                            the resort fees will be tacked on to the award cost. The next 2 sections offer some quirks of paying for
                            IHG stays.

                        <p>
                            Marriott allows for the flexibility to pay with a combination of points and cash. Usually poor value, since the cost to do so with
                            cash is a hair less than the award cents per point.

                            For Marriott members that have Silver, Gold, or Diamond status, every award stay with 5 or
                            more consecutive nights will have the fifth night free.
                            The maximum number of nights per stay is 20 nights, so a total of 4 free award nights per
                            stay. Note that pay with points and cash will not trigger this benefit.

                        <h3>Elite Status Requirements</h3>
                        <p>
                            Marriott now has 4 tiers of elite status after general members. Each night stayed, whether it's a cash, award, or credit 
                            card elite nights, will count toward the elite night threshold.
                            Here are the requirements to earn each status tier each year:<br>
                            <div class="indent1">
                                <b>Silver:</b> 10 elite nights

                            <div class="indent1">

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Just like all major hotel groups, elite nights and points are only earned when booking
                            direct or through portals like Amex FHR and Chase the Edit. It is
                            my opinion that the easiest way to qualify for Marriott elite status is to hold the applicable credit card.

                        <h3>Credit Card Elite Night Credit</h3>
                        <p>
                            In addition to Marriott credit cards automatically achieving status, they also come with elite nights awarded each year 
                            to help climb higher than the status provided. Most credit cards give 15 elite night credits, with the exception of 
                            the Amex Bonvoy Brilliant card, which comes in at 25 elite night credits. Keep in mind that these credits are not free nights 
                            to stay at a Marriott hotel, but only are there for elite status recognition. Unfortunately, only 1 personal card and 1 business 
                            Marriott card can contribute to elite night credits each year. This means that having multiple personal Marriott cards will only contribute 
                            15 elite night credits, unless you have the Amex Bonvoy Brilliant, which contributes 25. Likewise for the business Marriott cards. 
                            The strategy here is to hold both the Amex Bonvoy Brilliant and the Marriott business cards to achieve 40 elite nights.

                    <h2>Marriott Bonvoy Credit Cards</h2>
                    <p>
                        They are amongst the most expensive yet most hated cards in the game. Some of the perks are really strong, 
                        yet others are incredibly weak. I am here to go over some of the cards. The brand had a history of 
                        a huge merger with Starwood hotels, leading to co-branded cards with 2 different banks. Marriott 
                        was originally with Chase, while the Starwood brand was with Amex. In today's landscape, Chase typically
                        holds the lower annual feel cards while Amex holds the higher annual fee ones. <br>
                    </p>
                    <section id="cc--basic">
                        <h3>Chase Marriott Bonvoy Bold</h3>
                        <div id="table-container" data-table="28"></div>
                        <p>
                            The no annual fee Marriott Bonvoy is a great downgrade option, like every no annual fee
                            co-branded credit card. However, the free card punches above its weight class in several ways.
                            The card comes with automatic Marriott Silver status, although not much, is still something. 
                            You also get a pay yourself back feature for direct airline and Marriott bookings, only on this card. 
                            This lets you cash out 12,500 Marriott points for $100 statement credit, up to $750 per year, at a rate of 
                            0.8 cents per point. This means redemptions under than 0.8 cents per point would be better off redeemed for 
                            statement credit and paid with cash.

                        <h3>Chase Marriott Bonvoy Boundless</h3>
                        <div id="table-container" data-table="29"></div>
                        <p>
                            The Marriott Bonvoy Boundless card is good for 2 purpose after the welcome offer, the 35k free night certificate and the Marriott silver status.
                            Pegging each point at 0.8 cents per point, I would say that the free night certificates should at least be worth $280
                            if redeemed correctly. That exceeds the annual fee, which means that this card is a keeper card. The free night certificates 
                            can be topped off with a maximum of 15,000 additional Marriott points, so up to 50,000 point certificate. Note that 
                            in 2026, this card also comes with $100 in a airline statement credits, making this a greater card to keep.

                        <div id="table-container" data-table="30"></div>
                        <div id="table-container" data-table="25"></div>
                        <p>
                            This is by far the worst cards in their lineup. For an annual fee of $250, both cards offer Marriott gold status and no 
                            free night certificate without spend. They have the highest Marriott multipliers but they are not competitive with other credit cards at all.
                            If you want Marriott Gold status, apply for the Amex Marriott Business card instead.
                        </p>

                        <div id="table-container" data-table="26"></div>
                        <p>
                            This is the highest annual fee Marriott card and it definitely packs a punch. The card offers 3 big incentives, Marriott platinum status (what I consider to 
                            be the sweet spot), 25 elite night credits to help you reach Titanium or Ambassador status faster, and a 85,000 point free night certificate. 
                            The platinum status unlocks complimentary suite upgrades and breakfast benefits. The 85,000 point free night certificate is worth $680, with each point worth 0.8 cents per
                            point. Once again, the free night certificates can be topped off with a maximum of 15,000 additional Marriott points, so up to 100,000 point certificate.
                            The card comes with monthly dining credits to further offset the annual fee. For Marriott loyalist, this card is definitely worth the annual fee.

                        <p>
                            This card is pretty much a mirror copy of the Chase Bonvoy Boundless card. The only difference is the annual fee being $30 higher, business room rate discount, 
                            categories for bonus spend, and that the elite night credits stack with personal cards. Holding this card and the Amex Bonvoy Brilliant card will automatically propel 
                            you to 40 elite night credits each year.

                        <div id="table-container" data-table="24"></div>
                        <div id="table-container" data-table="31"></div>
                        <p>
                            There are 2 Marriott cards that were discontinued during the merger, yet can still be product changed into. The Amex Marriott Bonvoy is very similar to the Chase Marriott Boundless 
                            card in that it is under $100 annual fee and provides a 35,000 Marriott point free night certificate. It is a good option for downgrading the Marriott Brilliant or Bevy cards. The Ritz Carlton card is the card 
                            everyone talks about, primarily due to its overpowered priority pass. The card allows for unlimited authorized users with $0 annual fee and priority pass 
                            for each authorized user. Each of those priority pass holders gets access to the Chase Sapphire lounges the same way a Chase Sapphire Reserve card holder would.
                            This card's priority pass also gets the same travel and purchase protections as the Chase Sapphire Reserve card. This makes this card very similar to the travel 
                            benefits obtained on the Chase Sapphire Reserve for a much lower annual fee.
