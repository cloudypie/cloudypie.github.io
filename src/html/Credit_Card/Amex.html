                        Delta Skymiles, the most profitable airline in the world. Oh how some live and and die by them and others despise them 
                        for their greed. Despite its award program being known as Skypesos by the frequent flier community, I'm here to walk you 
                        thorough the in's and out's and how you can get the most out of this program.

                    <p> 
                        An airline hub is where the airline funnels all traffic in an out of. Today, the major airlines operate a hub and spoke model.
                        Those living in a hub would have the most direct flights while those that don't would most likely transit through one of the hubs.

                        Here are Delta's hubs in order of the market share at the airport. The higher the airport is on the list, the more likely that the
                        flight you want will be operated by Delta.

                        To complement their hubs, Delta also has focus cities. Although they do not have as many direct flights to
                        destinations as the hubs do, they still serve many non-hub destinations. The following airports are what I consider
                        to be Delta's focus cities today given the number of destinations served:
