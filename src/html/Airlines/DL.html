                        Delta SkyMiles, the most profitable airline in the world. Oh how some live and and die by them and others despise them 
                        for their greed. Despite its award program being known as Skypesos by the frequent flier community, I'm here to walk you 
                        thorough the in's and out's and how you can get the most out of this program.

                    <h2 id = "hub">Delta Hubs</h2> 
                    <p> 
                        An airline hub is where the airline funnels all traffic in an out of. Today, the major airlines operate a hub and spoke model.
                        Those living in a hub would have the most direct flights while those that don't would most likely transit through one of the hubs.

                        Here are Delta's hubs in order of the market share at the airport. The higher the airport is on the list, the more likely that the
                        flight you want will be operated by Delta.

                        To complement their hubs, Delta also has focus cities. Although they do not have as many direct flights to
                        destinations as the hubs do, they still serve many non-hub destinations. The following airports are what I consider
                        to be Delta's focus cities today given the number of destinations served:

                            Delta has two sets of fare classes. In both sets, they sell basic economy, main cabin, and comfort+ seats. 
                            In most domestic markets, their premium cabin is called first class. For international and a certain domestic routes, 
                            they have premium select and Delta One instead. For each fare class, I have listed the subsequent fare class letter in parenthesis. 
                            For those interested, they are in order of increasing price points, so the letter farthest left would be the cheapest fare and the letter
                            farthest right would be the most expensive.

                        <p> 
                            Basic economy (E), like all other airlines, is the cheapest but most restrictive fare class in Delta. Basic economy fares give you
                            all the same onboard experience (service, seat type, and amenities) as a regular economy seat would. However, unlike Delta's
                            competitors, they have quite a few policies that make them even more restrictive for Delta loyalists. Below are the items
                            to be aware of when booking basic economy.

                        <p> 
                            Main Cabin (V,X,T,U,L,K,Q,H,M,B,Y) are Delta's regular economy fares. Fare class V and X are deep discounted main. If you see one of these, don't hesitate!
                            It's most likely the cheapest fare you will find. Fare class T may sometimes mean that Delta is matching competitor fares. This may result in even lower prices than 
                            V or X fare class. The main perk of main cabin is the ability to make changes to the booking, select seats, and experience the SkyMiles program benefits.

                            First class (Z,I,D,C,J) is the premium cabin for most Delta's short haul international and domestic flights. The seats are more spacious and recline than economy seats.
                            The best way to think about the seats is like premium economy, even though the name is first class. There is also usually a bottle of water at the seat, predeparture 
                            drinks and complimentary alcholic beverages. First class also has the best selection of food and snacks on the flight.

                            Delta One (C,D,I,Z,J) is most premium cabin in Delta's lineup and is Delta's version of business class. Like Premium Select, this cabin is reserved for most Delta's 
                            short haul international and domestic flights. The seats are lie flat and have a lot more space than all other seats. They receive the best service onboard, best 
                            food and drink menu, and best amenity kits. Like premium select, they have access to Sky Priority but this is the only cabin class that could access Delta Skyclub
                            and Delta One lounges without a credit card or lounge membership. For flights that say Delta One suites, it just means that the seat will have access to doors and 
                            feel more private.

                        Delta has made Skymile accrual on their own metal and marketed flights very simple: just based off how much you spend and what elite status you are at. The
                        notable exception are basic economy tickets, which earn no SkyMiles. The following is the calculation of SkyMiles accrued on each flight: <br> <br>

                        <b>General Member:</b> 5 SkyMiles per dollar <br>

                            <b>American Express Membership Rewards:</b> All membership reward (MR) points earning cards can transfer MR to SkyMiles at a rate of 1 to 1.
                            This makes cards like the American Express Gold card, which earns 4x points per dollar on dining and groceries, effectively earn 4x points on 
                            grocery and dining purchases. However, keep in mind that American Express does charge an excise tax offset fee when transferring to 
                            US airlines. The cost to transfer points will be $0.0006 per pointfor a maximum of $99. This means a transfer of $10,000 MR points will
                            cost $6 and transferring $165,000 points or more will cost a flat fee of $99. <br><br>

                            <b>Marriott Bonvoy:</b> Marriott Points are also able to be transferred at a rate of 3 Bonvoy points to 1 SkyMiles. Generally, this is a 
                            terrible deal unless you are looking to top off a SkyMiles booking.

                        Although often referred to as SkyPesos, I am here today to show you a couple of the ways to redeem your SkyMiles for great value.

                        US carriers have one of the best online interface in relation to booking award flights. Delta, for instance, just requires you to check a box that says
                        "Shop with Miles" when searching for flights.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        There is even an award calendar when selecting "flexible with dates"->"Price Calendar". This will allow you to look at awards with a monthly view.

                    <p>Generally, these SkyMiles are worth around 1-1.3 cents per point. This applies even for business class flights, which is why people call the currency
                        SkyPesos. However, there are 3 things that stand out about Delta compared to other currencies.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>    
                            <b>Take Off 15: </b> All Delta credit card holders (except for Delta SkyMiles blue card) will get a 15% discount on Delta operated awards. This 
                            could bring the average value of flight awards to 1.3-1.5 cents per point. For domestic flights, this isn't too bad. This is also a discount, 
                            so you would only need the amount that they ask you to on screen.
                        </li>
                        <img src="/src/assets/Delta Guide/Takeoff15.png"> 
                        <li>
                            <b>Fuel Surcharges: </b> Delta does not pass on fuel charges to your award ticket. This is most important for when you look at flights from 
                            partner airlines, which some do try to charge their members, whereas Delta eats those fees for you.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Free Changes and Cancellation: </b> Probably the best thing about Delta awards is the ability to freely change and cancel tickets if not in Basic
                            Economy. This allows for a lot of flexibility and is a great program to book backup flights with. 
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                        An airline hub is where the airline funnels all traffic in an out of. Today, the major airlines operate a hub and spoke model.
                        Those living in a hub would have the most direct flights while those that don't would most likely transit through one of the hubs.
