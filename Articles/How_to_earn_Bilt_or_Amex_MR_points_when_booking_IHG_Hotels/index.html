                    There has not been enough buzz around how Rakuten silently (not many creators talked about it) has been added 
                    as a transfer and earn partner for IHG One rewards. This is an impromptu article as I feel that I need to 
                    get the word out there about this deal that has gone unnoticed. The ability to earn and convert IHG points into a 
                    transferrable currency has just been created. <br><br> For context, Rakuten is more commonly known as an online shopping
                    portal with rewards. They have the ability to convert 1% cashback into 1 Bilt or 1 Amex MR point. They are a key pillar 
                    for those in the points and miles game to quickly rack up miles.
                    I will walk through preliminary strategies that I thought of.
                    <a href="https://www.ihg.com/onerewards/content/gb/en/earn-rewards/rakuten"> official page</a> will 
                    include all the details of the rakuten and IHG partnership
                </p>

                <h2 id="earning">Earning Rakuten on Direct IHG Bookings</h2>
                <p>
                    The most straight forward of the bunch is to earn Rakuten points in lieu of IHG One points. You can 
                    earn 3x Rakuten points for each dollar you spend on IHG hotels. I do not recommend this approach as you are 
                    forfeiting any elite earn bonuses you would otherwise get.

                <h2 id="transfer">Transferring IHG points to Rakuten Points </h2>
                    <p>
                        IHG now allows you to transfer 3 IHG points to 1 Rakuten point. IHG points frequently go on sale for 
                        half a penny each, meaning if you take advantage of their point sales, then this will effectively be 
                        purchasing Rakuten points for 1.5 cents per point.

                        Although buying transferrable points for 1.5 cents per point is ok, it at least sets a floor for the 
                        maximum cost we should set for obtaining transferrable points over cash back.<br><br>
                        Although buying transferrable points for 1.5 cents per point is not the most exciting thing in the world, 
                        it at least sets a floor for the 
                        maximum cost we should set for obtaining transferrable points over cash back.

                    <p>
                        The real deal is converting organic IHG hotel points into transferrable currencies. For example, the current offer on 
                        the Chase IHG premier cards is 140,000 IHG points. Converting that into Rakuten or MR/Bilt points would be equivalent 
                        to 46.67k points. Sometimes, the offers for the business card extend up to 200k IHG points, which converts into 66.67k 
                        MR or Bilt points. Who said we don't have access to Bilt point welcome offers.

                    <h3>IHG Stays</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the same line of thinking, let's apply this to the most valuable earning rate of any hotel programs:
                        earning points for staying in their own branded hotels. IHG stays for properties that aren't candlewood 
                        suites and staybridge suites will earn 10x points per dollar spent. The same multiplier goes 
                        for using the IHG Premier and Premier business credit cards at IHG hotels and resorts. That is 3.33x MR points and Bilt points 
                        per dollar. While not industry leading for hotel stays, they are currency leading. 
                        Amex requires you to book through their travel portals to get 5x on hotels while Bilt only gives 2x.
                        Booking stays gets better as status goes on too. At the platinum level, it is 16 IHG points per dollar, meaning 
                        5.33 Bilt/MR points per dollar spent. If you add the earnings of the IHG Premier cards for a total of 26 points per dollar,
                        it comes out to 8.67 Bilt and MR points per dollar spent on booking direct with IHG hotels. That is a pretty 
                        good deal to me!
