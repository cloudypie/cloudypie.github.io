                    <p>
                        Welcome to my first blog! The number one thing people ask me on how to use miles
                        is how they can travel to see family within the United States. This guide will
                        be specifically for economy, to get from point A to point B the cheapest.
                        So grab onto your hats because we have some delving to do.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="alaska">Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan</h4>
                        <p>
                            The best sweet spot hands down within short to medium distances is Alaska Airlines
                            Mileage Plan. Mileage plan has the best short distance award chart PERIOD.
                            <br>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Between 0-1400 miles, Alaska Airlines clock in at or less than 7,500 miles. For
                            their own metal, their taxes and fees comes in at the $5.60 the TSA charges per
                            passenger. If miles are set equal to 1 cent per point, this means that for flights
                            up to 700 miles, they cost <b>$50.60</b> one way. Between 701 and 1400 miles, it will be
                            <b>$80.60</b>
                            one way. In a lot of cases, this will represent fantastic value, even comparable
                            to budget airline flights. What's more, Alaska Airlines doesn't charge a change fees
                            when changing or cancelling award tickets on their own metal.
                            <br><br>
                            Now, you might be thinking, "Hey, I don't live on the west coast so I don't fly on
                            Alaska Airlines." The good news is that Alaska Airlines is a part of the Oneworld Alliance,
                            meaning
                            that they are able to book American Airline flights.
                            This is a fantastic deal, even with the partner award fee for American Airlines
                            coming in at $12.50. Doing the same calculations, the flights under 700 miles comes to
                            <b>$57.50</b> and flights between 701 and 1400 miles cost <b>$87.50</b>. Unfortunately,
                            the partner booking fee is unrefundable if you do decide to change your ticket.

                                For lifemiles, the continuous United States is divided 3 zones. Alaska and Hawaii count
                                as their own separate zones.
                                The zones are divided by states and can be generalized as east, midwest and west.
                                Travel within each zone will cost 7,500 lifemiles and $5.60 in taxes and fees. Avianca
                                is a part of
                                star alliance, meaning it would have access to United Airlines flights. If the distance
                                is greater than 701 miles
                                and your final destination is within the same zone, consider searching on lifemiles for
                                United flights. The states
                                that are in each of the zones are listed below:

                            <h2 id="turkish">Turkish Airlines Miles and Smiles</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The next up is a Star Alliance power house, Turkish Airlines. Despite getting
                                    devalued
                                    earlier this year, the award chart within the United States still pose a great
                                    value.
                                    <br>
                                </p>
                                <img src="/assets/Miles_and_Smiles_America_AC.png">
                                <p>
                                    Any award within the United States cost 10,000 miles plus $5.60 in TSA fees. By in
                                    the United
                                    States, I mean <b>IN</b> the United States. This means from East coast to Hawaii and
                                    Alaska
                                    all for the cost of 10,000 miles and $5.60. Now, again, you might be thinking, well
                                    Turkish Airlines
                                    doesn't fly within the United States. Fortunately, United Airlines do. These awards
                                    apply to United
                                    Airlines. When calculating total cost with 1 cent equal to 1 mile, this comes up to
                                    $105.6 one way.
                                    Name a time you could fly from New York to Hawaii for this price. I can't think of
                                    one.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Now, a cautionary tale. United has been real stingy with award availability to
                                    partners recently
                                    so it may be harder and harder to find seats. Turkish Airlines also doesn't have the
                                    best award change
                                    policies or customer service so proceed with caution.
