                    Everyone always talks about how much value you can get by redeeming Delta SkyMiles abroad.
                    However, today, I will be sharing exactly how many miles you need and where you can go
                    to maximize your Delta SkyMiles. However, this is my first rough attempt so please email me
                    with any questions or comments if there is something that isn't explained well. I am still
                    working on adding a comment section and that will be coming out soon.

                <h2 id="economyac">Economy Award Chart</h2>
                <p>
                    Now lets get right to it! Here is the economy award chart for non US and Canada flights. The ?
                    represents parts of the award chart that I couldn't find example flights for.
                </p>

                    <i>
                        * Flights within the Americas differ by partners. Partners include Latam, WestJet, and
                        Aeromexico.<br>
                        ** Intra Asia flights are further classified into zones<br><br>
                    </i>
                    To me, a couple zones stand out. Europe to India at 35,000, Intra Africa for 22,500, and .
                    However, the economy award chart is not really competive as where things stand, since
                    for Intra Africa flights, where prices are high, there isn't much award availability.
                    This is due to Kenya Airways not releasing award availability to Delta as far as I found.
                </p>

                <h2 id="businessac">Business Award Chart</h2>
                <p>
                    As usual, the chances of getting outsized value are higher with business class award charts.

                    </i>
                    Here, there are a couple of competitive zones. Again, if Kenya Airways releases partner
                    availability, Intra Africa for 40,000 in business could be a good deal. Europe to Australia for
                    90,000 could be a great use case. Finally, 80,000 from Europe to Asia is pretty competive as well.

                <h2 id="americas">Americas Award Chart</h2>
                <p>
                    Within the Americas, there are further zones that are broken down. 
                </p>
                <h3 id="latam">Latam</h3>
                <p>
                    For flights within South America, Latam awards from Delta follow a distance based award chart. These
                    awards also cost by per segment, this means that a layover flight would be the sum of the cost for
                    each individual legs, not pricing the total distance traveled.

                <p>
                    <b>1 Layover: </b>1 layover still prices as a direct flight would. The start and final city
                    are the only considerations. CDG - RUH - DEL will price the same as CDG - DEL. <br><br>
                    <b>2 Layovers: </b>2 layover gets a bit tricky. If the operating airline is the same throughout,
                    say from CDG - JED - RUH - DEL all on Saudia, then the award would price the same as direct and 1
                    layover. However, if the operating carrier changes, then the award would be priced as if there
                    are 2 different awards being booked on each of the separate airlines. For example, NBO - AMS -
                    JED - BKK, where NBO - AMS - JED is on KLM and JED - BKK
