                <p>
                    Everyone always talks about how much value you can get by redeeming Delta SkyMiles abroad.
                    However, today, I will be sharing exactly how many miles you need and where you can go
                    to maximize your Delta SkyMiles. However, this is my first rough attempt so please email me
                    with any questions or comments if there is something that isn't explained well. I am still
                    working on adding a comment section and that will be coming out soon.
                </p>

                <h2 id="economyac">Economy Award Chart</h2>
                <p>
                    Now lets get right to it! Here is the one way economy award chart for non US and Canada flights.
                    Please note that Aerolineas Argentinas, Air Europa, China Eastern and Kenya Airways all seem to
                    not release award availability to Delta.
                </p>
                <img src="/assets/Other Articles/Delta Non-USCanada AC/overall_y_ac.png">
                <p>
                    <i>
                        * Flights within the Americas differ by partners. Partners include Latam, WestJet, and
                        Aeromexico.<br>
                        ** Intra Asia flights are further classified into zones<br><br>
                    </i>
                    To me, a couple zones stand out. Europe to South Asia at 35,000 SkyMiles, Intra Africa for 22,500
                    SkyMiles, and East Asia to Australia for 35,0000 SkyMiles. However, the economy award chart is not
                    really competive as where things stand, especially for Intra Africa flights, where prices are high,
                    there isn't much award availability. This is due to Kenya Airways not releasing award availability
                    to Delta as far as I found.
                </p>

                <h2 id="businessac">Business Award Chart</h2>
                <p>
                    As usual, the chances of getting outsized value are higher with business class award charts.
                </p>
                <img src="/assets/Other Articles/Delta Non-USCanada AC/overall_j_ac.png">

                        ** Intra Asia flights are further classified into zones.<br><br>
                    </i>
                    Here, there are a couple of competitive zones. Again, if Kenya Airways releases partner
                    availability, Intra Africa for 40,000 in business could be a good deal. Europe to Australia for
                    90,000 could be a great use case. Finally, 80,000 from Europe to Asia is pretty competive as well.

                    To understand a little of which destination is which, here is a compiled list of countries that are
                    a part of each zone. The parenthesis signal what zone these countries are in in the overall

                <h2 id="europe">Europe Exceptions</h2>
                <p>
                    Time to kick off the first of many complications with Delta's award chart.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Air France, KLM, and Tarom intra Europe economy awards cost 10,000 SkyMiles instead of
                        15,000 SkyMiles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Egypt switches zones depending on the other destination. Egypt will classify under
                        the Middle East if the flight is departing or arriving in Europe. However, if the flight
                        is departing or arriving in the middle east, Egypt will classify as part of North Africa/Europe.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For intra Europe zone, flights departing and arriving in the same country would cost double the
                        number of SkyMiles. For example, BCN-CDG-MAD would cost 20,000 SkyMiles in economy while
                        BCN-CDG-LIS would only cost 10,000 SkyMiles.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>


                <h2 id="americas">Americas Award Chart</h2>
                <p>
                    Within the Americas, each partner has their own award chart. I have ignored Delta Airlines and Cape
                    Air flights, as both of those seem to be priced dynamically.
                </p>
                <h3 id="americas--latam">LATAM</h3>
                <p>
                    For flights within South America, Latam awards from Delta follow a distance based award chart. These
                    awards also cost by per segment, this means that a layover flight would be the sum of the cost for
                    each individual legs, not pricing the total distance traveled. <br><br>

                    However, for flights out of South America, aka the last 3 rows of the chart, they follow the typical
                    zone based award chart. The layover rules below will apply.
                </p>
                <img src="/assets/Other Articles/Delta Non-USCanada AC/latam_ac.png">
                <p>
                    If you have a lot of SkyMiles, this would be a pretty good use case. However, there are more
                    competive
                    programs for awards on LATAM.
                </p>

                <h3 id="americas--aeromexico">Aeromexico</h3>
                <p>
                    Flights on Aeromexico follow a zone based award chart. I personally don't think there is any
                    exceptional opportunity here, given the short distance this award chart covers from Mexico. There
                    are better opportunities using Virgin Atlantic Miles instead.
                </p>
                <img src="/assets/Other Articles/Delta Non-USCanada AC/aeromexico_ac.png">

                <h3 id="americas--westjet">WestJet</h3>
                <p>
                    Delta SkyMiles guides often mention the value to be had redeeming SkyMiles for WestJet flights.
                    For flights more than 2 months out, flights within North America follow a set price. Flights within
                    Canada and the Continental US cost 12,500 SkyMiles in economy while flights to or from Hawaii will
                    cost
                    22,500 SkyMiles. For flights to the rest of North America, they have set pricing
                    depending on the city pairs but to me, it doesn't follow any rhyme or reason.<br><br>

                    Because cash prices can get kind of high, redemptions from US to Canada could provide great value
                    with proper planning.
                </p>

                <h3 id="americas--hawaiian">Hawaiian Airlines</h3>
                <p>
                    Hawaiian Airlines awards cost 7,500 SkyMiles for economy flight within the Hawaiian islands.
                </p>

                <h2 id="asia">Intra Asia Award Chart</h2>
                <p>
                    Within Asia, countries are further divided into 2 zones. From the award chart, Southeast Asia to
                    East Asia in business could be a great sweetspot. For example, Garuda Indonesia business from
                    Jakarta to Tokyo or Korean Air business from Seoul to Singapore only for 40,000 SkyMiles.<br><br>
                    <b>Economy</b>
                    <img src="/assets/Other Articles/Delta Non-USCanada AC/asiay_ac.png">

                <h3 id="asia--korean">Korean Air</h3>
                <p>
                    Now, it wouldn't be like Delta to not have exceptions here either. Korean Air has a special
                    rate for intra Korea and between Korea and Japan flights. Again, this could be an interesting
                    way to try out Korean Air business class for very few SkyMiles.
                </p>
                <img src="/assets/Other Articles/Delta Non-USCanada AC/korean_ac.png">

                <h3 id="asia--vietnam">Vietnam Airlines</h3>
                <p>
                    Flights within Vietnam will cost 12,500 SkyMiles in economy and 20,000 SkyMiles in business.
                    For the amount of distance that Vietnam covers, programs like Virgin Atlantic could be a
                    better choice.
                </p>


                <h2 id="layover">Layover Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>1 Layover</b><br><br>1 layover still prices as a direct flight would. The start and final city
                    are the only considerations. CDG - RUH - DEL will price the same as CDG - DEL. <br><br>
                    <b>2 Layovers</b><br><br>2 layover gets a bit tricky. If the operating airline is the same
                    throughout,
                    say from CDG - JED - RUH - DEL all on Saudia, then the award would price the same as direct and 1
                    layover. However, if the operating carrier changes, then the award would be priced as if there
                    are 2 different awards being booked on each of the separate airlines. <br><br>

                    For example, NBO - AMS -
                    JED - BKK, where NBO(Africa) - AMS - JED(Middle East) is on KLM and JED(Middle East) - BKK(Asia) on
                    Saudia Airlines, the cost would be 40,000 SkyMiles for Africa to Middle East and 40,000 SkyMiles for
                    Middle East to Asia for a total of 80,000 SkyMiles for the trip. <br><br>

                    However, the same flight but with the layovers in different cities would price different. NBO - JED
                    - AMS - BKK, where NBO(Africa) - JED - AMS(Europe) is on Saudia and AMS(Europe) - BKK(Asia) on
                    KLM, the cost would be 35,000 SkyMiles for Africa to Europe and 50,000 SkyMiles for Europe to Asia
                    for a total of 80,000 SkyMiles for the trip. <br><br>

                    As you can see, where the change in operating carriers matters because it would change in the price
                    of the award.
