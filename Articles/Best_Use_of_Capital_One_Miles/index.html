                <h1>Best Uses for Capital One Miles</h1>

                    To be blunt, Capital One miles are what I consider to be the second worst transferrable currency (after Wells Fargo)
                    in the US credit card game. However, that doesn't mean there isn't great value to be had. Since many people got into 
                    the Capital One miles ecosystem through getting the welcome offer on the 
                    VentureX, today I'll be covering what I think are the best use cases for 75,000 Capital One miles.
                </p>

                <h2 id="baseball">Baseball Tickets</h2>
                <p>
                    <img src="/assets/Other Articles/Best Use Capital One Miles/baseball.webp">
                    Since I personally know a few sports fans, this first section is for them. 
                    <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/benefits/entertainment/">Capital One entertainment</a> often sells great seats 
                    for MLB games for just 5,000 miles a piece. These are labeled as "card member exclusives" and are often pretty close to the action.
                    For the VentureX bonus, you can buy 15 tickets! Stock tends to run out decently fast so jump on them if you're interested.
                </p>

                <h2 id="turkish">Domestic Flights</h2>
                <p>
                    <img src="/assets/Other Articles/Best Use Capital One Miles/unitedstarliv.webp">
                    Outside of the baseball use case, airline transfer partners are typically where you get outsized value for your transferrable currencies.
                    I will kick off the transfer partners with a partner that is unique to only Capital One, Citi and Bilt: Turkish Airlines. Turkish airlines is 
                    really good for 1 thing: flying within the a single country. For 1 way, Turkish airlines allows for flights <b>ANYWHERE</b> 
                    within the same country for just 10,000 miles in economy and 15,000 miles in business. This means all the way 
                    from Hawaii to Maine, or from Alaska to Puerto Rico and anywhere in between. With a transfer ratio of 1:1, 
                    Capital One miles are able to effectively become Turkish miles for a great rate. Since Turkish Airlines is a part of Star 
                    Alliance, they partner up with United Airlines and are able to book some of their flights using miles.
                    Furthermore, United doesn't charge surcharges, meaning the total cost of an economy ticket would be 10,000 miles and $5.60 TSA 
                    fee, and 15,000 miles + $5.60 TSA fee for business class. This is a fantastic deal and best in the game for long distance flights within the 
                    US. Same principal goes for travel within other large countries, like Canada, China, and India, where prices could
                    be high. With the sign up bonus, that is 7 one way tickets in economy or 5 one way tickets in business.<br><br>

                    <i>*Keep in mind, United Airlines has become stingy with award availability in recent years, especially for business class
                    flights.</i>
                </p>
                
                <h2 id="af">Air France/KLM Economy</h2>
                <img src="/assets/Other Articles/Best Use Capital One Miles/AF-KLM.webp">
                <p>
                    This deal became even sweeter with Air France and KLM's own program miles devaluing. Now, in the context of everything 
                    else getting nerfed, this use case of Capital One miles shot up in priority. Specific, this deal relates to flying direct to or from either 
                    Paris or Amsterdam and the US. Since Virgin Atlantic, Air France, and KLM are all part of Skyteam, Virgin Atlantic is able to 
                    book Air France and KLM flights via Virgin Atlantic miles. Direct economy flights to/from Paris/Amsterdam and the east coast will cost 12,000 Virgin Atlantic 
                    flying club miles each way for off peak dates. Direct flights to or from Paris/Amsterdam and the west coast will cost 15,000 miles instead.
                    Keep in mind that there are taxes and fees but for departures from the US, they are much lower than departing from Europe. In addition,
                    east coast to Paris/Amsterdam will cost 48,500 miles while costing 77,500 miles from the west coast. Traveling to or from the east coast 
                    on Air France/KLM business class is one of the best business class deals left, while west coast cost a bit too high to recommend. 
                    Booking direct with Air France/KLM flying blue will cost 60,000 miles for any one way in business class from Europe to US.
                    Note that Air France/KLM are also transfer partners of Capital One miles so that is also an option as well.
                </p>


                <h2 id="qatar">QSuite</h2>
                <img src="/assets/Other Articles/Best Use Capital One Miles/QSuite.webp">
                <p>
                   The most highly acclaimed business class in the world. Known for having the quad seat (4 seats that are able to face each other), this 
                   airline has topped all business class rankings for many years now. Good news for award travelers is that Qatar is a part of the avios 
                   program. This means that any transfer to Avios can book QSuite and have expanded availability. For Capital One miles, transferring miles 
                   to British Airways Avios would be the easiest and most straight forward. You could also transfer to Finnair, then transfer the 
                   Avios there to British Airways Avios, since all Avios partners can transfer Avios at a rate of 1:1. This may be notable if there is a 
                   unique transfer bonus for just Finnair and not British Airways. The cost of Avios from anywhere in the US to Doha 
                   would be just 70,000 British Airways Avios for QSuite, a pretty good deal to try the world's best business class.<br><br>

                   <i>*Please note that Qatar is infamous for having multiple types of business class cabin configurations with some not as nice as the QSuite.
                    Do your due diligence on the specific route you fly to see if that flight has the product you want to fly.

                <h2 id="ana">ANA the Suite</h2>
                <img src="/assets/Other Articles/Best Use Capital One Miles/ANAflyinghonu.webp">
                <p>
                    As one of the best first class products in the world, Virgin Atlantic offers an opportunity to book ANA first class through their points.
                    Although devalued multiple times since inception, first class to or from the US and Tokyo on ANA booked through Virgin Atlantic 
                    is still undoubtedly be one of the best deals out there. Clocking in at 72,500 Virgin miles from the west coast, the price falls just 
                    under the threshold for the 75,000 Capital One miles challenge. Traveling to or from Hawaii and Japan on ANA first class 
                    (aka ANA the Suite) will run just 57,500 Virgin Atlantic miles. There's a special flight to/from Hawaii on ANA called "Flying Honu".
                    Their 3 special A380 turtle livery operate this route and bring a little extra flair to the journey.
                    Unfortunately, east coast to or from Japan will cost 85,000 Virgin Atlantic miles, which is outside the range of the welcome offer. However,
                    it is still a great price for how long you'll spend on the plane.<br><br>

                    <i>*ANA first class flights are often hard to come across, with usually just 1 seat available. For the most availability, check either 330 days out 
                        or within 14 days of departure. Also, keep in mind you must call Virgin Atlantic to book these awards, as they will not show up online. To find 
                        availability, search on a Star Alliance partner like United Airlines and then call Virgin Atlantic once you see the award you want on United's page. </i>

                <h2 id="cash">Honorable Mention: Purchase Eraser</h2>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I know a lot of people might not want to learn how to transfer to partners or watch baseball. Instead, you could always use Capital One 
                    VentureX's purchase eraser option to get 1 cent per point. Essentially, you can redeem points for statement credit against any travel related 
                    purchases, as long as it is within 90 days of purchase. This is the only acceptable way in my eyes to cash out the miles.
