                    Delta SkyMiles, the most profitable airline in the world. Oh how some live and and die by them
                    and others despise them
                    for their greed. Despite its award program being known as Skypesos by the frequent flier
                    community, I'm here to walk you
                    thorough the in's and out's and how you can get the most out of this program.

                    <h2> Delta Hubs</h2>
                    <p>
                        An airline hub is where the airline funnels all traffic in an out of. Today, most major airlines
                        operate a hub and spoke model.
                        Those living in a hub would have the most direct flights while those that don't would most
                        likely transit through one of the hubs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Delta has what I consider to be the most well rounded/best hubs. There are 2 hubs on each coast
                        for international gateways, 4 fortress hubs for serving
                        airports in the middle of the country, and La Guardia for more east coast to New York flights.
                        Here are Delta's hubs in order of the market share at the airport.
                        The higher the airport is on the list, the more likely that the
                        flight you want will be operated by Delta.

                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>

                            Boston Logan International Airport (BOS)

                        <li>
                            Seattle Tacoma International Airport (SEA)
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        To complement their hubs, Delta also has focus cities. Although they do not have as many direct
                        flights to
                        destinations as the hubs do, they still serve many non-hub destinations. The following airports
                        are what I consider
                        to be Delta's focus cities today given the number of direct destinations served:

                    <h2>Fare Classes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Delta has two sets of fare classes. In both sets, they sell basic economy, main cabin, and
                        comfort+ seats.
                        In most domestic markets, their premium cabin is called first class.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/assets/Delta Guide/domestic.png">
                    <p>
                        For international and a certain domestic routes, they have premium select and Delta One instead.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/assets/Delta Guide/international.png">
                    <p>
                        For each fare class, I have listed the subsequent fare class letter in parenthesis.
                        For those interested, they are in order of increasing price points, so basic economy is the
                        cheapest and First/Delta One is the most
                        expensive.
                    </p>
                    <section id="fareclass--basic">
                        <h3>Basic Economy</h3>
                        <p>
                            Basic economy (E), like all other airlines, is the cheapest but most restrictive fare class
                            in
                            Delta. Basic economy fares give you
                            all the same onboard experience (service, seat type, and amenities) as a regular economy
                            seat
                            would. However, the lack
                            of lounge access even with Delta credit cards and the inability to accrue SkyMiles on basic
                            economy is a Delta original. This would make
                            Delta basic economy the worst out of all basic economies in the United States in my opinion.
                            Below are the items
                            to be aware of when booking basic economy.

                        <p>
                            Main Cabin (V,X,T,U,L,K,Q,H,M,B,Y) are Delta's regular economy fares. Fare class V and X are
                            deep discounted main. If you see one of these, don't hesitate!
                            It's most likely the cheapest fare you will find. Fare class T may sometimes mean that Delta
                            is
                            matching competitor fares. This may result in even lower prices than
                            V or X fare class. The main perk of main cabin is the ability to make changes to the
                            booking,
                            select seats, and experience the SkyMiles program benefits.

                            The best way to think about the seats is like premium economy, even though the name is first
                            class. There is also usually a bottle of water at the seat, predeparture
                            drinks and complimentary alcholic beverages. First class also has the best selection of food
                            and
                            snacks on the flight.

                            Delta One (C,D,I,Z,J) is most premium cabin in Delta's lineup and is Delta's version of
                            business
                            class. Like Premium Select, this cabin is reserved for most Delta's
                            short haul international and domestic flights. The seats are lie flat and have a lot more
                            space
                            than all other seats. They receive the best service onboard, best
                            food and drink menu, and best amenity kits. Like premium select, they have access to Sky
                            Priority but this is the only cabin class that could access Delta Skyclub
                            and Delta One lounges without a credit card or lounge membership. For flights that say Delta

                            feel more private.

                        <h3>Credit Cards</h3>
                        <p>
                            American Express Delta credit cards can help accrue Delta SkyMiles. By using your SkyMiles
                            credit card to pay for purchases, you can
                            earn SkyMiles instead of the usual cashback or transferrable points. I get into more detail
                            in
                            my Delta SkyMiles credit card article
                            but earning SkyMiles through spend on the credit card is not the best available option as
                            seen
                            below.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Transfer Partners</h3>
                        <p>
                            <b>American Express Membership Rewards:</b> All membership reward (MR) points earning cards
                            can
                            transfer MR to SkyMiles at a rate of 1 to 1.
                            This makes cards like the American Express Gold card, which earns 4x points per dollar on
                            dining
                            and groceries, effectively earn 4x points on
                            grocery and dining purchases. However, keep in mind that American Express does charge an
                            excise
                            tax offset fee when transferring to
                            US airlines. The cost to transfer points will be $0.0006 per pointfor a maximum of $99. This
                            means a transfer of $10,000 MR points will
                            cost $6 and transferring $165,000 points or more will cost a flat fee of $99. <br><br>

                            <b>Marriott Bonvoy:</b> Marriott Points are also able to be transferred at a rate of 3
                            Bonvoy
                            points to 1 SkyMiles. Generally, this is a
                            terrible deal unless you are looking to top off a SkyMiles booking.

                        <h3>Everyday Partners</h3>
                        <p>
                            These direct partners will earn X amount of SkyMiles based on the amount of money spent.
                            Generally, these are positive, since it's better to earn something instead of
                            nothing. A couple of the more notable partners are listed below: <br><br>
                            <b>Airbnb: </b> By booking through <a

                            Airbnb
                            stays will earn 1 SkyMile per dollar spent.<br><br>
                            <b>Hertz: </b> SkyMiles can be earned based off of how much money spent and the elite status
                            of
                            members when attaching SkyMiles number to your Hertz booking. This is
                            instead of earning Hertz's reward currency so if you often get Hertz rentals, this might not
                            be
                            a good value proposition. <br>

                        <b>Starbucks: </b> SkyMiles are now only earned from reloading monday in your Starbucks account.
                        This is more of a hassle
                        but if you frequent Starbucks, then this could be worth doing. However, do keep in mind that the
                        amount of SkyMiles earned are
                        in increments based off of certain money thresholds, with the $100 reload giving most amount of
                        SkyMiles per dollar, at 2 SkyMiles per dollar rate.

                        <h3>Delta Affiliate Portals</h3>
                        Like many other loyalty programs, Delta uses their popularity to try to sell services and
                        products
                        through their affiliate portals. By clicking through
                        these portals, you are earning SkyMiles instead of other miles or the product's own loyalty
                        points.
                        As such, I would not recommend using these methods to book,

                            US carriers have one of the best online interface in relation to booking award flights.
                            Delta,
                            for instance, just requires you to check a box that says
                            "Shop with Miles" when searching for flights.

                        <p>
                            There is even an award calendar when selecting "flexible with dates"->"Price Calendar". This
                            will allow you to look at awards with a monthly view.

                        <p>Generally, these SkyMiles are worth around 1-1.3 cents per point. This applies even for
                            business
                            class flights, which is why people call the currency

                        <p>
                            Delta has a wide selection of partners that SkyMiles can be redeemed. However, as a trend
                            with
                            Skyteam alliance in general, airlines are releasing
                            less and less award availability so finding flights to redeem can be a YMMV moment. The
                            <b>best</b> way to redeem SkyMiles for outsized value is
                            to redeem on partner flights that don't originate or end in the United States or Canada.
                            That is
                            because Delta has a
                            <a href="/html/Other Articles/Delta's Hidden Award Chart.html">hidden award chart</a> for
                            those flights. <br><br>

                            To summarize the article, some of the sweetspots include Europe to Asia in business for
                            80,000
                            SkyMiles, Europe to Middle East in business for 42,500
                            SkyMiles, 7,500 SkyMiles in economy and 15,000 SkyMiles in business from Japan to Korea.
                            <br><br>

                            While other blogs have touted the value of using SkyMiles on WestJet, I have found that
                            WestJet
                            flights are in fact dynamic so proceed with caution.<br><br>

                            As of February 2025, I could only find availability for the following carriers. Do keep in
                            mind
                            that availability could change at any time, but
                            interestingly, all Chinese SkyTeam carriers are absent.

                            Instead of paying cash, Delta can upgrade your flight using miles. This generally has a
                            value
                            slightly higher than 1 cent per point but not by much.

                                <b>Premium Drinks at SkyClub: </b> Purchasing drinks at SkyClub will yield 1.5 cents per
                                SkyMiles. This is actually a pretty good use of points
                                if you want an alcoholic beverage at the lounge.

                                This
                                is incredibly poor
                                value, as the Take Off 15 wouldn't apply and it would generally cost less to book an
                                award
                                ticket.

                        <p>
                            Some of the benefits can be attributed Skyteam Elite status. Delta Silver will match to
                            Skyteam
                            Elite while Delta Gold and above will
                            match to Skyteam Elite Plus. Some of the benefits I find valuable are the free checked bags,
                            Skyteam lounge access and complimentary upgrades
                            when available.

                        <p>
                            For those that reach platinum or diamond medallion, you can receive choice benefits. The
                            options
                            are as follows:

                        <p>
                            Out of all of these, my pick would be the 4 regional upgrade certificates for platinum
                            medallion
                            members or the 4 global
                            upgrade certificates for the diamond medallion members. I think these would provide the most
                            value. Otherwise,
                            I would take the SkyMiles option or the statement credit if you own a credit card and no
                            longer
                            want to fly Delta, since I value SkyMiles more than a penny each.
                            I think SkyMiles would any day beat the Delta Travel Voucher but the Delta Vacations choice
                            is
                            up to personal preference.

                            Delta Allows for status to be reclaimed in case of life events. According to sources online,
                            lots of events could qualify if you call Delta.
                            All you would have to do once approved is to reach the MQD threshold for your status, same
                            as
                            the status match threshold.

                    <h2>SkyMiles Credit Cards</h2>
                    <p>
                        Delta credit cards are very powerful for those traveling on Delta. Since my home airport is serviced the most by Delta, I 
                        frequently fly on Delta. My personal pick is to have either the Delta Business Gold or the Delta Business Platinum card, 
                        due to the Delta stays credit being higher on the business cards. These two cards are what I find to be the sweet spot in the 
                        Delta credit card line up. <br>
                    </p>
                    <section id="cc--blue">
                        <h3><a id="amexdelbcc" href="#">Delta SkyMiles Blue</a> </h3>
                        <p>
                            There is not much to write home about the Delta Blue card, except this is a $0 annual fee card. This means that
                            it is a great downgrade option for personal Delta cards.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section id="cc--gold">
                        <h3><a id="amexdelgcc" href="#">Delta SkyMiles Gold</a> and <a id="amexdelbgcc" href="#">Delta SkyMiles Gold Business</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            These cards get pretty exciting. There is a $0 introductory annual fee before $150 on renewal, meaning you can try the 
                            card out for a year to see if you like it. The card's main benefit is giving free checked bags for you and up to 8 companions.
                            For those that fly with checked bags, this could save a lot of money. The card also unlocks Take Off 15, giving a 15% 
                            discount on Delta operated award flights. The Delta Stays, especially on the business card, is a great way to offset the annual fee. 
                            The business gold has a $150 annual credit while the personal only has a $100 credit. The business gold card is a great card for 
                            those that fly Delta a couple of times a year with checked bags. 
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section id="cc--plat">
                        <h3><a id="amexdelpcc" href="#">Delta SkyMiles Platinum</a> and <a id="amexdelbpcc" href="#">Delta SkyMiles Platinum Business</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            These two cards also hold the same perks as the Delta Gold cards. The main difference is the introduction of additional coupons to offset 
                            and even exceed the value of the annual fee. The main benefits and reason to hold the card instead of the Delta Gold card is the annual 2,500 MQDs 
                            and annual companion certificate. Holding 4 Delta Platinum or Reserve (business and/or personal) cards will automatically grant you Delta Gold Medallion status.
                            This is enough to be a Skyteam Elite Plus member, give you access to SkyTeam benefits and lounge access. The companion certificate the card comes with 
                            is valid for any round trip main cabin Delta operated flight within North America (excluding Canada) and the Carribeans. This could honestly 
                            represent a ton of outsized value if used correctly, sometimes even upwards of $1000. Holding 4 Delta Platinum (personal or business) cards could 
                            automatically give you Delta Gold Meddallion status and 4 companion certificates for $1,400. This is before factoring all the credits as well. 
                            I didn't mention the redundant benefits on the Delta Gold cards because why would you get the Delta Platinum cards for benefits already found on the Delta Gold card for 
                            a lower annual fee. Even though the Delta Platinum does earn MQD on spend, the Delta Reserve cards are a better card for that purpose, as they earn
                            more MQDs per dollar spent.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                    <section id="cc--reserve">
                        <h3><a id="amexdelrcc" href="#">Delta SkyMiles Reserve</a> and <a id="amexdelbrcc" href="#">Delta SkyMiles Reserve Business</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            Again, the Delta Reserve cards build on the benefits and coupons of the Delta Platinum cards. The main selling point is the Delta SkyClub
                            access the Delta Reserve cards provide. However, they are limited to 15 visits a year unless you spend $75,000 that year. Since the Amex Platinum
                            card also provides 6 SkyClub visits a year, for the casual flyers of Delta, I would recommend getting the Amex Platinum card instead. However, for 
                            the extreme loyalists of the airline, the card can get the most MQD for spend, at a rate of 1 MQD per $10. The card is the best for those
                            wishing to spend towards status. Also for all the ballers flying in first class, the annual companion certificate has the same restrictions 
                            as the Delta Platinum companion certificates, except it also allows for bookings in first class. I would say the main draw of this card 
                            is the ability to spend towards Delta elite status, for those that visit SkyClubs very often, and the elevated companion certificate.
