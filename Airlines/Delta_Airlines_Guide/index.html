                    Delta SkyMiles, the most profitable airline in the world. Despite its award program being known as
                    Skypesos by the frequent flier community, I'm here to walk you
                    thorough the in's and out's and how you can get the most out of this program.

                    <h2> Top 5 Takeaways</h2>
                    <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>Basic Economy: </b>Delta basic economy is one of the most restrictive amongst the
                            airlines in the country for frequent fliers. Unlike other airlines, basic economy doesn't
                            accrue any SkyMiles, MQD, miles for Million Miler status, nor have SkyClub access even with
                            credit cards and lounge memberships that are supposed to give you access. The fare class
                            also doesn't allow for seat selection upon booking, even for a fee.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Flash Sales: </b>Delta often has <a
                                href="https://www.delta.com/us/en/flight-deals/skymiles-award-deals">flash sales</a>
                            that bring up the value of their SkyMiles. However, even with flash sales, business class on
                            Delta often remain uncompetitive compared to other programs. Economy, on the other hand, can
                            often times be incredibly lucrative in and be really cheap.

                        <li>
                            <b>Take Off 15: </b>Delta credit cards (except the Amex Delta Blue) reduce Delta operated
                            award prices by 15%.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Companion Certificates: </b>Both the personal and business Delta Platinum and Reserve
                            credit cards give a companion certificate
                            upon card renewal each year. This perk could give outsized value for card holders.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>MQD headstart: </b>By holding 4 Delta personal or business platinum/reserve cards, you
                            could earn 10,000 MQDs automatically each
                            year (2500 MQD per card). This is enough for Delta Gold Medallion status, equivalent to
                            SkyTeam Elite Plus. By product changing to Delta
                            business or personal platinum cards and holding 4 of them, you could effectively buy Delta
                            Gold Medallion status for $1400. This is
                            not even including the 4 companion certificates and rideshare, delta stays, and resy credits
                            you would receive for holding the cards.

                    <h2> Delta Hubs</h2>
                    <img src="/assets/Delta Guide/Delta Map.webp">
                    <p>
                        Delta has what I consider to be the most well rounded/best hubs. There are 2 hubs on each coast
                        for international gateways, 4 fortress hubs for serving
                        airports in the middle of the country, and La Guardia for more east coast to New York flights.
                        Here are Delta's hubs in order of the market share at the airport.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport (MSP)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            LaGuardia Airport (LGA)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Boston Logan International Airport (BOS)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Seattle Tacoma International Airport (SEA)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To complement their hubs, Delta also has focus cities. Although they do not have as many direct
                        flights to
                        destinations as the hubs do, they still serve many non-hub destinations. The following airports
                        are what I consider
                        to be Delta's focus cities today given the number of direct destinations served:

                    <h2>Fare Classes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Delta has two sets of fare classes. In both sets, they sell basic economy, main cabin, and
                        comfort+ seats. In most domestic markets, their premium cabin is called first class.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/assets/Delta Guide/domestic.webp">
                    <p>
                        For most long haul international and a couple domestic flight, Delta offers premium select and
                        Delta One instead.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/assets/Delta Guide/international.webp">
                    <p>
                        For each fare class, I have listed the subsequent fare class letter in parenthesis.
                        For those interested, they are in order of increasing price points, so basic economy is the
                        cheapest while First/Delta One is the most
                        expensive.

                        <p>
                            Basic economy (E), like all other airlines, is the cheapest but most restrictive fare class
                            in Delta. Basic economy fares give you all the same onboard experience (service, seat type,
                            and amenities) as a regular economy seat would. However, Delta differentiates itself from competition
                            by not allowing SkyClub access while holding an eligible credit card and not earning SkyMiles 
                            or MQDs on paid basic economy fare.

                            Main Cabin (V,X,T,U,L,K,Q,H,M,B,Y) are Delta's regular economy fares. Fare class V, X, and T are
                            the cheapest ticket price. If you see one of these, don't hesitate to buy! Basic economy fare 
                            buckets match main cabin ones, even if the fare codes all say E. As such, basic economy fares 
                            are also the cheapest when Main Cabin displays V, X, or T fare codes.

                            US carriers have one of the best online user interfaces for booking award flights. Delta,
                            for instance, just requires you to check a box that says "Shop with Miles" when searching
                            for flights.

                        <p>Generally, these SkyMiles are worth around 1-1.3 cents per point. This even applies to
                            business
                            class flights, hence why people call the currency

                            those flights. <br><br>

                            To summarize the article, some of the sweetspots include Europe to Australia in business for
                            90,000 SkyMiles, WestJet economy within the continental United States and Canada for 12,500
                            SkyMiles, and East Asia to Southeast Asia in business for 40,000 SkyMiles.
                            <br><br>

                            While other blogs have touted the value of using SkyMiles on WestJet, I have found that
                            WestJet flights are in fact dynamic, so proceed with caution.<br><br>

                            As of February 2025, I could only find availability for the following carriers. Do keep in
                            mind
                            that availability could change at any time, but
                            interestingly, all Chinese SkyTeam carriers are absent.

                            up to personal preference.

                        <p>
                            Delta Allows for status to be reclaimed in case of life events. According to sources online,
                            plenty of events could qualify if you call Delta.
                            All you would have to do once approved is to reach the MQD threshold for your status, same
                            as the status match threshold.

                    <h2>SkyMiles Credit Cards</h2>
                    <p>
                        Delta credit cards are very powerful for those traveling on Delta. Since my home airport is
                        serviced the most by Delta, I
                        frequently fly on Delta. My personal pick is to have either the Delta Business Gold or the Delta
                        Business Platinum card,
                        due to the Delta stays credit being higher on the business cards. These two cards are what I
                        find to be the sweet spot in the
                        Delta credit card line up. <br>
                    </p>
                    <section id="cc--blue">
                        <h3>Delta SkyMiles Blue</h3>
                        <div id="table-container" data-table="1"></div>
                        <p>
                            There is not much to write home about the Delta Blue card, except that this is a $0 annual
                            fee card. It serves as a great downgrade option for personal Delta cards.

                        <p>
                            For a $0 introductory annual fee
                            before $150 on renewal, you can test drive the card.
                            The card's main benefit is giving free checked bags for you and up to 8 companions and Take Off 15
                            (15% discount on Delta operated award flights).
                            The $150 Delta Stays credit, especially on the business card, is a great way to offset the annual fee.

                        <div id="table-container-4" data-table="4"></div>
                        <div id="table-container-5" data-table="5"></div>
                        <p>
                            The main reason to hold the card instead of the Delta Gold card is the annual
                            2,500 MQD head start and annual companion certificate. Holding 4 Delta Platinum or Reserve (business
                            and/or personal) cards will automatically grant you Delta Gold Medallion status, enough to be a Skyteam Elite Plus Member
                            and getting access to SkyTeam partner lounges. <br><br>
                            The companion certificate the card comes with is valid for any round trip main cabin Delta
                            operated flight within North America (excluding Canada) and the Caribbeans. This could
                            honestly represent a ton of outsized value if used correctly, sometimes even upwards of
                            $1000. Holding 4 Delta Platinum (personal or business) cards could automatically give you
                            Delta Gold Medallion status and 4 companion certificates for $1,400.
                            This is before factoring all the credits as well.

                        <div id="table-container-6" data-table="6"></div>
                        <div id="table-container-7" data-table="7"></div>
                        <p>
                            The flag ship benefit of the Delta Reserve cards are the Delta SkyClub access.
                            However, they are limited to 15 visits a year unless you spend $75,000 that year. Since the
                            Amex Platinum card also provides 6 SkyClub visits a year, for the casual Delta flyers, I
                            would recommend holding the Amex Platinum card instead. <br><br>
                            However, the other flagship perk is that the card can get the most MQD for spend,
                            at a rate of 1 MQD per $10. The card is the best for those wishing to spend towards status.
                            Lastly, for all the ballers flying in first class, the annual companion certificate has the
                            same restrictions as the Delta Platinum companion certificates, except it also allows for
                            bookings in first class.
