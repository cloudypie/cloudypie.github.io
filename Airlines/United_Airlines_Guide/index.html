                <p>
                    As a challenger trying to dethrone Delta Airlines, United Airlines is on the path to be the most
                    profitable airline in the world.
                    As such, they have been upping their game recently. They have expanded their route network, added
                    premium touches to their
                    soft product, starting to refresh their polaris seats, and revamping their credit cards. Here is a
                    guide to their program.

                    <p>
                        United Airlines runs hubs in some of the highest earning cities in the US. Furthermore, only 2 of
                        their hubs are hubs
                        of other full service carriers (LAX and ORD). In the case of Chicago Ohare, they are beating
                        American Airlines by a
                        handy margin. Although they are losing to Delta Airlines in LAX, United bases
                        most of their transpacific operations out of SFO. Their hubs are as below:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Denver International Airport (DEN)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD)

                        <li>
                            Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR)

                    <p>
                        To complement their hubs, United has a couple of flights not operated
                        to or from their hub airports. I would consider these more like focus cities.

                    <h2>Fare Classes</h2>
                    <p>
                        United divided their fares into 5 different buckets. Keep in mind, Basic Economy, Economy, and Fully Refundable 
                        Economy all have the same seats, just different refund policies. Polaris, business and first class will all full under the right most bucket, depending 
                        on the route. Only one fare will exist for each route but expect that one of the 3 will always be the most premium 
                        fare. 
                    </p>

                        <h3>Basic Economy</h3>
                        <p>
                            Basic economy (N), like all other airlines, is the cheapest but most restrictive fare class
                            in United. Basic economy fares give you all the same onboard experience (service, seat type,
                            and amenities) as a regular economy seat would. 
                            However, United's basic economy differs from its competition in that it does not allow for a free
                            carry-on.

                            Economy (G,L,K,S,T,Q,V,W,M,E,H,U,B,Y) United's standard seats. Fare class G is
                            the
                            LOWEST discounted economy price. If you see one of these, don't hesitate to buy. Basic economy fare buckets match main cabin ones, 
                            even if the fare codes all say N. As such, basic economy fares are also the cheapest when economy displays K, L, T, or S fare codes.
                            Do note that while economy tickets can select seats, selecting "Economy 
                            plus" seats will cost extra. These seats tend to be located in the exit row, or front of the cabin.

                        Today, there are many ways to earn MileagePlus, through both flying and non-flying means.
                        Obviously, spend on United MileagePlus credit card will earn MileagePlus but I have saved that
                        for a later section.

                        <h3>Transfer Partners</h3>
                        <p>
                            <b>Chase Ultimate Rewards:</b> All ultimate rewards (UR) points to MileagePlus at a rate of 1 to 1
                            through the sapphire cards or ink preferred card.. This makes cards like the <a
                                id="cfucc" href="#">Chase Freedom Unlimited</a>, which earns 3x points per dollar
                            on dining and drugstores, effectively earn 3x United miles on dining and drugstores. Given that the value of MileagePlus is
                            not typically the best value when compared to other transfer partners like Air Canada's Aeroplan, I would discourage transferring unless to top
                            off points for a redemption.<br><br>

                            <b>Bilt Rewards:</b> All Bilt points transfer to United Mileageplus at a rate of 1 to 1. Same story for value here.<br><br>

                            <b>Marriott Bonvoy:</b> Marriott Points are also able to be transferred at a rate of 2
                            Bonvoy points to 1 MileagePlus if transferring in increments of 60,000 Marriott Bonvoy points. It used to be a terrible deal but during 
                            typical Marriott point sales, if you buy at 0.89 cents per point, then transfer to United, it is effectively buying United miles at 1.78 cents per 
                            point. This is usually cheaper than when United miles are on sale for 1.88 cents per point.

                    <p>
                        I would say that United miles are in the middle of the pack, not as lucrative as American Airlines but not as atrocious as Delta Skymiles for 
                        redeeming on business class.

                                United MileagePlus members can create a <a href="https://www.united.com/en/us/mileageplus/miles-pooling/">pool</a> for their miles. Members in this pool 
                                can decide how many miles they want to contribute and the creator/leader can decide who can redeem the miles.
                                There is a maximum of 4 members in a pool, with the miles in the pool only able to be redeemed for United operated 
                                flights.

                            US carriers have one of the best online user interfaces for booking award flights. United,
                            for instance, just requires you to click "Book"->"Award Travel"
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There is even an award calendar when selecting "Flexible dates" when selecting your itinerary. This
                            will allow you to look at awards with a monthly view.

                        <p>Generally, these MileagePlus are worth around 1-1.5 cents per point. This applies even for
                            business
                            class flights, which is why people call the currency
                            SkyPesos. However, there are 4 things that stand out about United compared to other
                            currencies.

                                partner airlines, which some do try to charge their members, whereas United eats those
                                fees
                                for you.

                        <h3>Partner Flight </h3>
                        <p>
                            United has a very large selection of partners that MileagePlus can be redeemed for. Generally, 
                            the best value can be had from redeeming on partner award flights, specifically for Star Alliance 
                            flights. A highlight of United's program in this regard is the lack of fuel surcharges and booking fees
                            tacked onto partner flights, such as Lufthansa and ANA. I am working on an article compiling an 
                            unofficial partner award chart for United's MileagePlus program.
                            
                            <!-- I have compiled a 
                            <a href="/Articles/Uniteds_Hidden_Award_Chart/">hidden award chart</a> for
                            redeeming United miles on partners. <br><br> -->

                            <!-- To summarize the article, some of the sweetspots include Europe to Australia in business for
                            90,000 MileagePlus, WestJet economy within the continental United States and Canada for
                            12,500
                            MileagePlus, and East Asia to Southeast Asia in business for 40,000 MileagePlus
                            <br><br>

                            While other blogs have touted the value of using MileagePlus on WestJet, I have found that
                            WestJet
                            flights are in fact dynamic so proceed with caution.<br><br>

                            As of February 2025, I could only find availability for the following carriers. Do keep in
                            mind
                            that availability could change at any time, but
                            interestingly, all Chinese SkyTeam carriers are absent.

                            For those that reach Premier Platinum and 1K, you can receive 40 PlusPoints for Premier Platinum 
                            and 280 PlusPoints for Premier 1K. PlusPoints can be used for guaranteed upgrades as seen in the table 
                            below.

                            Additionally, they can be used to exchange for other elite status perks, miles or Travel bank cash, as seen 
                            below.

                            The way I would use PlusPoints is to upgrade from long haul economy to Polaris. With that in mind, 
                            you would be able to upgrade once with reaching Premier Platinum and 4 times with reaching Premier 1K.

                            For every 1 million miles flown, United awards lifetime elite status. United counts miles flown on cash booked United 
                            operated flights. For each lifetime status, a <b>companion</b> can also receive the lifetime status too.
                            Companions can be chosen each year and is a great way to get player 2 on board with flying so much. Each threshold Million miler thresholds

                    <p>
                        United credit cards are very powerful for those traveling on United. From my view, there is generally 
                        2 strategies for the cards. For those that are casual enjoyers of the United Club lounge, an United business 
                        card paired with an United Gateway card can be highly synergistic. Instead of just holding an United Explorer card 
                        for the checked bag and 2 Club passes, holding an United business card and gateway card can provide all that and 
                        an additional 5,000 United miles each year. For avid United fans chasing status or frequently visit the United 
                        clubs, the United Club card would be the way to go.<br>

                        <p>
                            There is not much to write home about the United Gateway card, except that this is a $0 annual
                            fee card. This means that it is a great downgrade option for personal United cards.

                            The United Explorer and Business cards start coming with introductory perks for a low annual fee. 
                            The main draws for these cards are the checked bag benefits and the united club passes. As mentioned earlier, the business card is generally 
                            going to be more valuable for most people. For most people getting a card of this tier, it is expected to 
                            at least fly 5 times a year. Triggering the $125 credit for 5 flights should be easy for the target audience 
                            for this card. Pair that with the "Better together" anniversary bonus of 5,000 miles, this could easily recoup 
                            the annual fee of the card.

                        <p>
                            Hot take, but I find this card to be extremely lackluster. It just doesn't feel like the card 
                            can provide anymore outsized value than the explorer card could. Some could argue that there are 
                            more credits to justify the annual fee. However, why would I get a card, spend time and effort just 
                            to use the credits and break even? Many of the perks also overlap with the Explorer card. The only time I would recommend this card is if they fly 
                            United often with 2 checked bags and absolutely do not value United Club access at all.

                            The flag ship benefit of the United Club cards are the United Club access. Since both cards also provide 2 free checked bags, this is why I mentioned that 
                            the Quest card would only be valuable for those that do not value United Clubs at all. Both cards come 
                            with Avis President's Club, which is Avis's highest status and not one that any other credit card will 
                            provide. For those chasing elite status, 
                            the personal club card will grant 1,500 PQP each year just for holding the card and 1 PQP per $15
                            spent on it. The card also gives a 
                            10% discount on economy saver awards in continental US and Canada, similar to a perk found on the Delta 
                            cards. To top it off, the card also grants IHG Platinum status.
