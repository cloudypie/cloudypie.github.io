                    As a challenger trying to dethrone Delta Airlines, United Airlines is on the path to be the most
                    profitable airline in the world.
                    As such, they have been upping their game recently. They have expanded their route network, added
                    premium touches to their
                    soft product, starting to refresh their polaris seats, and revamping their credit cards. Here is a
                    guide to their program.

                    <h2> United Hubs</h2>
                    <p>
                        An airline hub is where the airline funnels all traffic in an out of. Today, most major airlines
                        operate a hub and spoke model.
                        Those living in a hub would have the most direct flights while those that don't would most
                        likely transit through one of the hubs.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/assets/United Guide/United Map.webp">
                    <p>
                        United Airlines runs its operations out of hubs. These hubs connect smaller regional cities to
                        the rest of the
                        country and world, typically with only one stop. A unique dynamic for United is that most of
                        their hubs are
                        hubs unique to only the airline. They face little competition in most of their hubs. Only 2 of
                        their hubs are hubs
                        of other full service carriers (LAX and ORD). In the case of Chicago Ohare, they are beating
                        American Airlines by a
                        handy margin. However, they are losing to Delta Airlines in LAX but LAX is not as important to
                        United, since they base
                        most of their transpacific operations out of SFO. Their hubs are as below:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Denver International Airport (DEN)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD)

                            Houston George Bush International Airport (IAH)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            San Francisco International Airport (SFO)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Los Angeles (LAX)

                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        To complement their hubs, United has a couple of flights not operated
                        to or from their hub airports from the following airports:

                    <ul>
                        <li>

                    <h2>Fare Classes</h2>
                    <p>
                        United divided their fares into 4 different buckets. These generally change the hard and soft
                        product
                        passengers experience, except between basic economy and main economy, in which case will
                        experience the same
                        products.
                    </p>

                        <h3>Basic Economy</h3>
                        <p>
                            Basic economy (N), like all other airlines, is the cheapest but most restrictive fare class
                            in United. Basic economy fares give you all the same onboard experience (service, seat type,
                            and amenities) as a regular economy seat would. <br><br>

                            However, the difference will come with ancillary purchases, like checked bags, change fees
                            and elite perks.<br>

                            United's basic economy differs from its competition in that it does not allow for a free
                            carry-on.

                        <h3>Main Cabin</h3>
                        <p>
                            Main Cabin (G,K,L,T,S,W,V,Q,H,U,E,M,B,Y) are United's regular economy fares. Fare class G is
                            the
                            deepest discounted main. If you see one of these, don't hesitate! It's most likely the
                            cheapest
                            fare you will find. Subsequently, since all basic economy fare classes are identified as n,
                            if Main Cabin displays G for the same flight, then that means the same basic economy
                            fare will be at its lowest price point too. Fare class K, L, T, and S are also deep discount
                            tickets,
                            and could represent a good time to buy too. The
                            main perk of main cabin is the ability to make changes to the booking, select seats, and
                            enjoy MileagePlus perks.

                            First class (Z,I,D,C,J) is the premium cabin for most United's short haul international and

                            to think about the seats is like premium economy, even though its called first class. There
                            is also usually a bottle of water at the seat, predeparture drinks and complimentary
                            alcoholic beverages. First class also has the best selection of food and snacks on the
                            flight.

                            international and domestic flights. The seats are lie flat and have a lot more space than
                            all other seats. They receive the best service onboard, best food and drink menu, and best
                            amenity kits. Like premium select, they have access to Sky Priority but this is the only
                            cabin class that could access United Skyclub and United One lounges without a credit card or
                            lounge membership. For flights that say United One suites, it just means that the seat will
                            have a door, offering more privacy.

                    <p>
                        Today, there are many ways to earn MileagePlus, through both flying and non-flying means.
                        Obviously, spend on United MileagePlus credit card will earn MileagePlus but I have saved that
                        for a
                        later section.

                            United has made Skymile accrual on their own metal and marketed flights very simple: just
                            based off how much you spend and what elite status you are at. The notable exception are
                            basic economy tickets, which earn no MileagePlus. The following is the calculation of
                            MileagePlus
                            accrued on each flight: <br> <br>

                        <p>
                            <b>American Express Membership Rewards:</b> All membership reward (MR) points earning cards
                            can transfer MR to MileagePlus at a rate of 1 to 1. This makes cards like the <a
                                id="amexgcc" href="#">American Express Gold card</a>, which earns 4x points per dollar
                            on dining
                            and groceries, effectively earn 4x points on grocery and dining purchases. However, keep in
                            mind that American Express does charge an excise tax offset fee when transferring to
                            US airlines, including United. The cost to transfer points will be $0.0006 per point for a
                            maximum of $99. This means a transfer of 10,000 MR points will cost $6 and transferring
                            165,000 points or more will cost a flat fee of $99. Given that the value of MileagePlus is
                            not
                            high compared to other Amex transfer partners, I would discourage transferring unless to top
                            off points for a redemption.<br><br>

                            <b>Marriott Bonvoy:</b> Marriott Points are also able to be transferred at a rate of 3
                            Bonvoy points to 1 MileagePlus. Generally, this is a terrible deal unless you are looking to
                            top off a MileagePlus booking.

                            <b>Hertz: </b> MileagePlus can be earned based off of how much money spent and the elite

                            instead of earning Hertz's reward currency so if you often get Hertz rentals, this might not
                            be

                        This is more of a hassle
                        but if you frequent Starbucks, then this could be worth doing. However, do keep in mind that the

                            Like many other loyalty programs, United uses their popularity to try to sell services and
                            products through their affiliate portals. By clicking through these portals, you are earning
                            MileagePlus instead of other miles or the product's own loyalty points. As such, I would not
                            recommend using these methods to book, as there are more ways to get value. <br>

                        Although often referred to as SkyPesos, I am here today to show you a couple of the ways to
                        redeem your MileagePlus for great value.

                            US carriers have one of the best online user interfaces for booking award flights. United,
                            for instance, just requires you to check a box that says "Shop with Miles" when searching
                            for flights.

                        <p>
                            There is even an award calendar when selecting "flexible with dates"->"Price Calendar". This
                            will allow you to look at awards with a monthly view.

                        <p>Generally, these MileagePlus are worth around 1-1.3 cents per point. This applies even for
                            business
                            class flights, which is why people call the currency
                            SkyPesos. However, there are 4 things that stand out about United compared to other
                            currencies.

                                recent flash sale included booking basic economy tickets from the US to Europe for
                                32,000
                                MileagePlus round-trip. This also stacks with the Take Off 15
                                mentioned below to get a round trip price of 27,000 MileagePlus. Do keep in mind that I

                                been tracking prices for a while and US to Europe basic

                                could bring the average value of flight awards to 1.3-1.5 cents per point. For domestic

                        <p>
                            United has a wide selection of partners that MileagePlus can be redeemed. However, as a
                            trend
                            with
                            Skyteam alliance in general, airlines are releasing
                            less and less award availability so finding flights to redeem can be a YMMV moment. The
                            <b>best</b> way to redeem MileagePlus for outsized value is
                            to redeem on partner flights that don't originate or end in the United States or Canada.
                            That is
                            because United has a
                            <a href="/Articles/Uniteds_Hidden_Award_Chart/">hidden award chart</a> for
                            those flights. <br><br>

                            To summarize the article, some of the sweetspots include Europe to Australia in business for
                            90,000 MileagePlus, WestJet economy within the continental United States and Canada for
                            12,500
                            MileagePlus, and East Asia to Southeast Asia in business for 40,000 MileagePlus
                            <br><br>

                            While other blogs have touted the value of using MileagePlus on WestJet, I have found that
                            WestJet
                            flights are in fact dynamic so proceed with caution.<br><br>

                            As of February 2025, I could only find availability for the following carriers. Do keep in
                            mind
                            that availability could change at any time, but
                            interestingly, all Chinese SkyTeam carriers are absent.

                            Some of the benefits can be attributed Skyteam Elite status. United Silver will match to

                            Skyteam lounge access and complimentary upgrades

                            For those that reach platinum or diamond medallion, you can receive choice benefits. The
                            options
                            are as follows:

                        <p>
                            Out of all of these, my pick would be the 4 regional upgrade certificates for platinum
                            medallion
                            members or the 4 global
                            upgrade certificates for the diamond medallion members. I think these would provide the most
                            value. Otherwise,
                            I would take the MileagePlus option or the statement credit if you own a credit card and no
                            longer
                            want to fly United, since I value MileagePlus more than a penny each.
                            I think MileagePlus would any day beat the United Travel Voucher but the United Vacations
                            choice
                            is

                        <p>
                            United Allows for status to be reclaimed in case of life events. According to sources
                            online,
                            lots of events could qualify if you call United.
                            All you would have to do once approved is to reach the MQD threshold for your status, same
                            as
                            the status match threshold.

                    <h2>MileagePlus Credit Cards</h2>
                    <p>
                        United credit cards are very powerful for those traveling on United. Since my home airport is
                        serviced the most by United, I
                        frequently fly on United. My personal pick is to have either the United Business Gold or the
                        United
                        Business Platinum card,
                        due to the United stays credit being higher on the business cards. These two cards are what I
                        find to be the sweet spot in the
                        United credit card line up. <br>
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            There is not much to write home about the United Blue card, except that this is a $0 annual
                            fee card. This means that it is a great downgrade option for personal United cards.

                        <h3>United MileagePlus Gold and United
                            MileagePlus Gold Business</a></h3>

                        <div id="table-container-2" data-table="2"></div>
                        <div id="table-container-3" data-table="3"></div>
                        <p>
                            The United Gold cards start packing more benefits. There is a $0 introductory annual fee
                            before $150 on renewal, meaning you can try the card out for a year to see if you like it.
                            The card's main benefit is giving free checked bags for you and up to 8 companions.
                            For those that fly with checked bags, this could save a lot of money.<br><br>
                            The card also unlocks Take Off 15, giving a 15% discount on United operated award flights.
                            The United Stays, especially on the business card, is a great way to offset the annual fee.
                            The business gold has a $150 annual credit while the personal only has a $100 credit. The
                            business gold card is a great card for those that fly United a couple of times a year with
                            checked bags.

                        <div id="table-container-5" data-table="5"></div>
                        <p>
                            These two cards also hold the same perks as the United Gold cards. The main difference is
                            the
                            introduction of additional coupons to offset and even exceed the value of the annual fee.
                            <br><br>
                            The main benefits and reason to hold the card instead of the United Gold card is the annual
                            2,500 MQDs and annual companion certificate. Holding 4 United Platinum or Reserve (business
                            and/or personal) cards will automatically grant you United Gold Medallion status.
                            This is enough to be a Skyteam Elite Plus member, give you access to SkyTeam benefits and
                            lounge access. <br><br>
                            The companion certificate the card comes with is valid for any round trip main cabin United
                            operated flight within North America (excluding Canada) and the Carribeans. This could
                            honestly represent a ton of outsized value if used correctly, sometimes even upwards of
                            $1000. Holding 4 United Platinum (personal or business) cards could automatically give you
                            United Gold Medallion status and 4 companion certificates for $1,400.
                            This is before factoring all the credits as well.

                            <br><br>
                            Even though the United Platinum does earn MQD from spend, the United Reserve
                            cards are a better card for that purpose, as they earn
                            more MQDs per dollar spent.

                        <div id="table-container-6" data-table="6"></div>
                        <div id="table-container-7" data-table="7"></div>
                        <p>
                            Again, the United Reserve cards build on the benefits and coupons of the United Platinum
                            cards. The main selling point is the United SkyClub access the United Reserve cards provide.
                            However, they are limited to 15 visits a year unless you spend $75,000 that year. Since the
                            Amex Platinum card also provides 6 SkyClub visits a year, for the casual flyers of United, I
                            would recommend getting the Amex Platinum card instead. <br><br>
                            However, for the extreme loyalists of the airline, the card can get the most MQD for spend,
                            at a rate of 1 MQD per $10. The card is the best for those wishing to spend towards status.
                            <br><br>
                            Also for all the ballers flying in first class, the annual companion certificate has the
                            same restrictions as the United Platinum companion certificates, except it also allows for
                            bookings in first class. I would say the main draw of this card is the ability to spend
                            towards United elite status, for those that visit SkyClubs very often, and the elevated
                            companion certificate.
