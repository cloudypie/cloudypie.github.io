                        Delta Skymiles, the most profitable airline in the world. Oh how some live and and die by them and others despise them 
                        for their greed. Despite its award program being known as Skypesos by the frequent flier community, I'm here to walk you 
                        thorough the in's and out's and how you can get the most out of this program.

                        Hello viewers of the blog. I am a travel enthusiast and love to use points and miles
                        to travel around the world for cheap. I am currently working in a standard job so 
                        I don't have as much time to travel as some of the other bloggers out there. But as
                        an engineer by trade, I hope to bring logical analysis to find the best value for 
                        your points and miles.
