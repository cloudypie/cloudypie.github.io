                <h1>Economy Sweet Spots Within United States</h1>
                <p class="post-meta">
                    <i>November 18, 2024 by Worldly Express </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my first blog! The number one thing people ask me on how to use miles
                    is how they can travel to see family within the United States. This guide will
                    be specifically for economy, to get from point A to point B the cheapest.
                    I am specifically avoiding including dynamic award programs (United, Delta, Air Canada,
                    and American Airlines) because their value will fluctuate with cash prices.
                    So although they could provide <b>good</b> value, they would never provide <b>great</b> value.
                </p>

                <h2 id="alaska">Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan</h2>
                <p>
                    The best sweet spot hands down within short to medium distances is Alaska Airlines
                    Mileage Plan. Mileage plan has the best short distance award chart <b>PERIOD</b>.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <img src="/assets/Domestic Sweet Spots/Alaska_metal_AC.png">
                <p>
                    Between 0-1400 miles, Alaska Airlines clock in at or less than 7,500 miles. For
                    their own metal, their taxes and fees comes in at the $5.60 the TSA charges per
                    passenger. If miles are set equal to 1 cent per point, this means that for flights
                    up to 700 miles, they cost <b>$55.60</b> one way. Between 701 and 1400 miles, it will be
                    <b>$80.60</b> one way. In a lot of cases, this will represent fantastic value, even comparable
                    to budget airline flights. What's more, Alaska Airlines doesn't charge a change fees
                    when changing or cancelling award tickets on their own metal.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, you might be thinking, <i>"Hey, I don't live on the west coast so I don't fly on
                        Alaska Airlines."</i> The good news is that Alaska Airlines is a part of the Oneworld Alliance,
                    meaning that they are able to book <b>American Airline</b> flights.
                </p>
                <img src="/assets/Domestic Sweet Spots/Mileage_Plan_America_AC.png">
                <p>
                    This is a fantastic deal, even with the partner award fee for American Airlines
                    coming in at $12.50. Doing the same calculations, the flights under 700 miles comes to
                    <b>$57.50</b> and flights between 701 and 1400 miles cost <b>$87.50</b>. There is no change
                    fee if you change flights with the same operating carrier. Unfortunately,
                    the partner booking fee is nonrefundable if you do decide to change your ticket.
                </p>
                <h2 id="turkish">Turkish Airlines Miles and Smiles</h2>
                <p>
                    The next up is a Star Alliance power house, Turkish Airlines. Despite devaluations, the award chart
                    within the United States still pose a great value.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <img src="/assets/Domestic Sweet Spots/Miles_and_Smiles_America_AC.png">
                <p>
                    Any award within the United States cost 10,000 miles plus $5.60 in TSA fees. By in the United
                    States, I mean <b>IN</b> the United States. This means from East coast to Hawaii and Alaska
                    all for the cost of 10,000 miles and $5.60. Now, again, you might be thinking, well Turkish
                    Airlines doesn't fly within the United States. Fortunately, <b>United Airlines</b> do. These awards
                    apply to Star Alliance partners, which United Airlines is a part of. When calculating total cost
                    with 1 cent equal to 1 mile, this comes up to <b>$105.6</b> one way. Name a time you could fly from
                    New York to Hawaii nonstop for this price. I can't think of one.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>*Now, a note of caution. United is rather real stingy with award availability to partners
                        recently
                        so availability may not be the easiest to find. Turkish Airlines also doesn't have the best
                        award change policies or customer service so proceed with caution.</i>
                </p>
                <h2 id="other">Other Options</h2>
                <p>
                    The above 2 programs represent the absolute best ways to get good value on domestic redemptions.
                    However, Alaska is not a transfer partner to the major bank currrencies and Turkish Airlines is
                    only a transfer partner of Citi Thank You Points and Capital Miles. Furthermore, sometimes a route
                    is only served by one of the big 3 airlines, like Delta, which neither programs cover. I will list
                    some alternative programs below that still allow you to use points on domestic redemptions.<br><br>
                    <b>Delta: </b> Air France Flying Blue can be used as an alternative for Delta redemptions. <br><br>
                    <b>United: </b> Avianca doesn't publish an award chart but flying within one of their "zones"
                    (US is broken up into East coast, Central and West Coast) rings up 10,000 miles. Otherwise, for
                    longer distances, Singapore Airlines Kris Flyer will cost 14,000 one way to anywhere within
                    North America except Hawaii. <br><br>
                    <b>American, Alaska, JetBlue: </b> Qatar Airways Avios (able to be transferred 1 to 1 from any avios
                    program). Ok for short distance flights.
